I would like to typify every sentence used in this summery into half a dozem categories.

I am writing about Deacon's work who in turn writes about other people's work who in turn write about yet other people's work.

When I write a sentence I want to be able to identify the source amd purpose of that sentence. 

First: Does the sentence I write summarize a thought belonging to Deacon or another? 

Second: is the matrerial 'fresh meat' or somrthing else.

All of this is part of the process of mechanizing the process of creating a summary.

***

- also history? What would be the difference between the two?
