Live Demo: http://absence.github.io/cookbook/ottojenny/r1/ottojenny.html

Ottojenny Release 1 is an extremely basic app ( the simplest that Theo could think of ) that 
shows one object interacting with another (by 'gobbling' it). 
The app displays a hundred cubes in 3D space each with a random position and velocity. 
The enclosing cube is 100 times the size of the smaller cubes.
When one object approaches within one unit of another, the second object is deleted and the first object is scaled up in dimension.

This app was created just to get things started. Who knows what release 23 will do? 

You will need a computer and browser that supports [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/) in order to view the app. Use the Google Chrome browser if you can.
The app is unlikely to work on your phone or tablet - though there are exceptions and slow performance is likely to be an issue.

You may pan, zoom and rotate the display using your mouse or touchpad:
* Rotate: left finger/button down
* Pan: right button/ two fingers down
* Zoom: mouse wheel / two finger swipe

The smaller cubes cast shadows on the table. This is to help you gauge the total number of objects being displayed.
