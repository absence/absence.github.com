     <h2>Chapter 17 ~ Consciousness</h2> 
    <h3>The hierarchy of sentience - p508</h3>
    <p>sentience is a typical emergent attribute of any teleodynamic system</p>
    <p>But no possibility of reducing these higher-order forms (e.g., human consciousness)
      to lower-order forms</p>
    <p>irreducible to lower but could not exist without lower process</p>
    <p>there will be a sentience characteristic for each level</p>
    <p>all these forms of sentience should be operative in parallel in the functioning
      of complex nervous systems.</p>
    <p>The two levels are phenomenally discontinuous, which is to say that a neuron's
      sentience comprises no fraction of your sentience.</p>
    <p>this second-order teleodynamics is analogous to the way that the teleodynamics
      of interacting organisms within an ecosystem can contribute to higher-order population
      dynamics, including equilibrating (homeodynamic) and self-organizing (morphodynamic)
      population effects.</p>
    <p>- see example of the termite realm</p>
    <p>The various nested levels of sentienc from molecular to neuronal to mental are
      thus mutually inaccessible to one another, and can exhibit quite different properties.</p>
    <p>So, while the lower level of cellular sentience cannot be dispensed with, it is
      a realm apart from mental experience. There is the world of the neuron and the
      world of mind, and they are distinct sentient realms.</p>
    <p>So subjective sentience is fundamentally more complex and convoluted in its teleodynamic
      organization. It therefore exemplifies emergent teleodynamic properties that are
      unprecedented at the lower level</p>
    <h3>Emotion and energy - p511</h3>
    <p>In other words, certain ubiquitous aspects of mental experience should inevitably
      exhibit organizational features that derive from, and assume certain dynamical
      properties characteristic of, thermodynamic and morphodynamic processes. To state
      this more concretely: experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative,
      and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These
      are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience. What do
      these dynamical features correspond to in our phenomenal experience?</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking, this dynamical infrastructure is 'emotion' in the most general
      sense of that word.</p>
    <p>It is the tension that separates self from non-self; the way things are and the
      way they could be; the very embodiment of the intrinsic incompleteness of subjective
      experience that constitutes its perpetual becoming.</p>
    <p>Both the motive and resistive aspects of experience are thus commonly expressed
      in energetic terms.</p>
    <p>mentality as fluid, kundalini, doshas, humors, elan vital, libido, vitalist</p>
    <p>mentaility as an energetic process.</p>
    <p>Gregory Bateson argued that the appropriate way to conceive of mental processes
      was in informational and cybernetic terms. p514.</p>
    <p>Energy and information are asymmetrically and hierarchically interdependent dynamical
      concepts, which are linked by virtue of an intervening level of morphodynamic processes.</p>
    <p>mental experience neither ebb and flow of a vital fluid nor buildup and release
      of energy nor with signal petterns. p 516</p>
    <p>Each neuron is bombarded with signals that constitute its Umwelt p516</p>
    <p>As in other statistical dynamical regularities, there are a vast number of microstates
      (i.e., network activity patterns) that can constitute the same global attractor,
      and a vast number of trajectories of microstate-to-microstate changes that will
      tend to converge to a common attractor.</p>
    <p>This shift in level makes it less clear that we can simply dismiss these folk
      psychology force-motion analogies. If the medium of mental representation is not
      mere signal difference, but instead is the large-scale global attractor dynamic
      produced by an extended interconnected population of neurons, then there may also
      be global-level homeodynamic properties to be taken into account as well. As we
      have seen in earlier chapters, these global dynamical regularities will exhibit
      many features that are also characteristic of force-motion dynamics.</p>
    <p>The thermodynamics of though - p 517 -- note error in book's section heading:
      &quot;though&quot; not &quot;thought&quot;</p>
    <p>any mental content, whether emerging from memory or induced by sensory input,
      should take time to develop. Second, it should require something like a persistent
      metabolic boost, to provide a sufficient period of incessant perturbation to build
      up local signal imbalances and drive the formation of larger-scale attractor regularities.
      p518</p>
    <p>Third, because of the time it takes for the non-linear recursive circulation of
      these signals to self-organize large-scale network dynamics, mental content should
      also not emerge all or none into awareness, but should rather differentiate slowly
      from vague to highly detailed structures. p518</p>
    <p>This means that the differential distribution of metabolic support in the brain
      will itself play a major role in determining what morphodynamic processes are likely
      to develop when and where. p519</p>
    <p>This means that if there is a means to globally regulate the distribution of the
      brain's metabolic resources that is, by up- and down-regulating rates of regional
      cerebral blood flow this could also be a means of initiating and developing, or
      impeding and degrading, certain local morphodynamic tendencies.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, because of the time it takes for morphodynamic activity to differentiate
      to a regular attractor stage, mental processes likely take place at rates that
      are commensurate with metabolic time scales; and in the case of highly complex
      and highly robust morphodynamic attractors, this may take longerperhaps many seconds
      to reach a stage of full differentiation. p521</p>
    <p>It is my hypothesis, then, that this resistance and work created by these dependencies
      between levels of dynamics of brain processes constitutes the experience of emotion.
      523-524</p>
    <p>-- p 523 how might animal instincts come into this?</p>
    <p>This emergent dynamic account thus effectively distinguishes the conscious from
      unconscious generation of thoughts and attentional foci in terms of work. The more
      work at more levels, the more sentient experience. And where work is most intense,
      we are most present and actively sentient. Self and other, including the otherness
      created by the inertia of our own neural dynamics, are thus brought into stark
      relief by the contragrade tensions that arise because we are constituted dynamically.
      p524</p>
    <p>But as we have already come to realize, the sort of teleodynamics that arises
      from brain process is at least a second-order form of teleodynamics when compared
      to that which constitutes life.</p>
    <h3>Whence suffering? - p 524</h3>
    <p>This is because sentience inevitably has a valence. Things feel good and bad,
      they aren't merely good for or bad for the organism. p 524</p>
    <p <p="">There are emergent sentient properties produced by the teleodynamics of brains
      that are not produced by simpler, lower-order forms of sentience. Crucially, these
      are special normative properties made possible because the sentience generated
      by brain processes is, in effect, a second-order sentience: a sentience of sentience.
      And with this comes a sentience of the normative features of sentience. In colloquial
      terms, this sentience of normativity is the experience of pleasure and pain, joy
      and suffering. p 525</p>
    <p>Generation of a projected future self-in-context thus can become a critical source
      of constraints organizing the whole system. p 526</p>
    <p>It was noted that particularly in cases of life-and-death contexts, morphodynamic
      change must be instituted rapidly and extensively, and this requires extensive
      work at both the homeodynamic (metabolic) and morphodynamic (mental) levels. The
      extent of this work and the intensity of the tension created by the resistance
      of dynamical processes to rapid change is, I submit, experienced as the intensity
      of emotion. p 527</p>
    <p>The ephemeral nature of teleodynamics guarantees that it faces an incessant war
      against intrinsic and extrinsic influences that would tend to disrupt it and the
      more disruptive of its self-similarity maintenance, the greater the work that must
      be performed to resist this influence. p 527</p>
    <p>The capacity to suffer requires the higher-order teleodynamic loop that brain
      processes make possible. It requires a self that creates within itself a teleodynamic
      reproduction of itself. This emergent dynamical homunculus p 528</p>
    <p>Since the locus of this self-perspective is dynamically determined with respect
      to the 'boundaries' of morphodynamic reciprocities, and these are changing and
      differentiating constantly, there can be no unambiguous anatomical correlate of
      this homunculus within the brain. p530</p>
    <p>Perception is not merely the registration of extrinsically imposed changes of
      neural signals. It involves the generation of local morphodynamic processes that
      remain integrated into the larger teleodynamic integrity and yet are at the same
      time modulated by these extrinsically imposed constraints. p 531</p>
    <p>pain = special form of perception</p>
    <p>pain that cannot be relieved = suffering</p>
    <p>pain is only for the smart</p>
    <p>pain is the essence of neurological sentience.</p>

    <h3>Being here - p 532</h3>
    <p>the very locus of teleodynamic closure becomes virtual. p532</p>
    <p>So, even though this is a theory which defends the thesis that intentional relationships
      and sentient experiences are not material phenomena in the usual sense of that
      concept, it nonetheless provides us with a thoroughly empirical set of predictions
      and testable hypotheses about these enigmatic relationships. p 537</p>
    <h3>Conclusion of the beginning - p 537</h3>
    <p>We are incomplete in our very nature.</p>
    <p>I believe that despite its counterintuitive negative framing, this figure/background
      reversal of the way we conceive of living and mental causality promises to reinstate
      subjective experience as a legitimate participant in the web of physical causes
      and effects, and to ultimately reintroduce intentional phenomena back into the
      natural sciences.</p>
    <p>Mind didn't exactly emerge from matter, but from constraints on matter.</p>
