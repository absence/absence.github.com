	<h2>Epilogue</h2>
		<p><i>All sciences are now under the obligation to prepare the ground for the future task of the philosopher, 
			which is to solve the problem of value...</i> &mdash; Friedrich Nietzsche</p>

	<h3>NOTHING MATTERS - p 539</h3>
	
		<p>How far have we journeyed? Are we there yet? 
			Certainly, nothing lost on the way. Laws of physics are still intact. 
			I see myself more like the hole in the hub than the rim on the wheel. p540</p>
		
		<p>We are reconceptualized by constraints - by properties or degrees of freedom not actualized.</p>
		
		<p>It's all a familiar figure/background reversal. No new science needed. [Or intelligent design.]</p>
		
		<p>We begin to understand that two levels of processes may become so entangled 
			that they become a dynamical unit that creates, preserves and replicates the very contraints that first brought the two processes together. p540</p>
		
		<p>Are we back to zero/Zero? Can a study of the absential provide a new tools?</p>
		
		<p>It's time to recognize that there is room for meaning, purpose, and value in the
			fabric of physical explanations, because these phenomena effectively occupy the
			absences that differentiate and interrelate the world that is physically present.
			p541</p>
			
		<p>[We have everything to lose. And nothing to gain ;-]</p>	
	
	<h3>THE CALCULUS OF INTENTIONALITY - p 541</h3>
	
		<p>Autogenic processes - a thought experiment - the premature halting of morphodynamic
			processes - the failure to continue - creates an entropy ratchet.</p>
		
		<p>Teleodynamics enables potentially indefinite to enable something intrinsically
			incomplete to bring itself into existence.</p>
		
		<p>-- Millikan's lion vs Shroedinger's cat?</p>
		
		<p>- The zero, differentiation and integration of absentialism has been described. p542</p>
		
		<p>Function is a geometric or formal relationship, not a material efficient one.</p>
		
		<p>Specifying a function is like a differentiation in calculus - specifying an intrinsic
			(instantaneous) telos.</p>
		
		<p>Value of physical attributes to overall teleodynamics can be estimated - is the
			analogue of integration in calculus.</p>
		
		<p>With emergence of teleodynamics, nature begins to discover zero.</p>
		
		<p>This needed existence of complex molecules capable of forming into autogenic configurations.</p>
		
		<p>Life and mind are the embodied calculus of physical processes leaping up from
			one teleodynamic level to the next.</p>
	
	<h3>VALUE - p 543</h3>
		<p>Natural sciences appears to have no place for right/wrong, meaningful/meaningless,
			beauty/ugliness, good/evil, love/hate, and so forth. p543</p>
		
		<p>For many people nihilism more threatening than death &lt;&lt; thus the need religion?</p>
		
		<p>The universe is is much larger than what we can see and touch and manipulate with
			out hands or our cyclotrons.</p>
		
		<p>There is more here than stuff. There is how stuff is organized and related to
			other stuff. And then there is more than what is actual. p 544</p>
		
		<p>There is what could be, what should be, what could be, what can't be, what is
			possible and what is impossible.</p>
