    <p>In what follows I will use the term morphodynamics to characterize the dynamical
      organization of a somewhat diverse class of phenomena which share in common the
      tendency to become spontaneously more organized and orderly over time due to constant
      perturbation, but without the extrinsic imposition of influences that specifically
      impose that regularity.</p>

    <p>This tendency to redistribute constraint to higher-order dimensions is an orthograde
      tendency of a different and independent kind than the spontaneous constraint dissipation
      that characterizes simpler thermodynamic systems. Yet without the incessant process
      of lower-order constraint dissipation, it would not occur. The higher-order orthograde
      morphodynamic tendency is in this sense dynamically supervenient on the lower-order
      orthograde thermodynamic (homeodynamic) tendency, though it is not supervenient
      in a mereological sense.</p>
