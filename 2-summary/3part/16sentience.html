    <h2>Chapter 16 ~ Sentience</h2> 
    
	<h3>Missing the forest for the trees - p 485</h3>
    <p>Can a machine be sentient? Feel joy? Have ethical values?</p>
    <p>Or a distinctive quality to experience - quale</p>
    <p>Core feature of conscious experience: sentience</p>
    <p>Sentience part of a cohort of phenomena, roots in far simpler physical phenomena</p>
    <p>Unlike machines, organisms do not merely react, but are organized to initiate
      change</p>
    <p>Thoughts (teleodynamic) must emerge from neurological (morphodynamic)</p>
    <p>Thus open to scientific investigation</p>
    <p>Current investigations by others investigate physical only</p>
    <p>Need to look beyond the neuronal details</p>
    <h3>Sentience versus intelligence - p 490</h3>
    <p>Turing test investigates intelligence, but not sentience</p>
    <p>Searle's Chinese room &lt;&lt; I don't get the point here yet</p>
    <p>2nd generation Turing test: test for intention and sentience</p>
    <p>-- page 493. Testing for sentience will become and ongoing series of challenges
      and responses</p>
    
	<h3>The complement to computation - p 494</h3>
    <p>Can mental processes be fully understood using physical tokens?</p>
    <p>If so, then mind/body problem disappears. Or does it?</p>
    <p>1. Not committed to a particular theory</p>
    <p>2. What is the correspondence between physical and representation? p 494</p>
    <p>Computation is merely a way of describing (or prescribing) machine processes.
      It is not an intrinsic property of any given machine process.</p>
    <p>Computation and natural selection: both agnostic. abstractions. generic instructions</p>
    <p>Computation: only changes of state described as functional can be favored</p>
    <p>Organism: changes generate regularities - morphodynamic organization</p>
    <p>Computation only transfers extrinsically imposed constraints from substrate to
      substrate</p>
    <p>Cognition (semiosis) generates intrinsic constraints that have a capacity to propagate
      and self-organize.</p>
    <p>Needed: an account where relative interpretive process is intrinsic not extrinsic.</p>
    
	<h3>Computing with meat - p 498</h3>
    <p>Terry Bisson: Thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat!</p>
    <p>Design principle of brain does not compute</p>
    <p>Brains: Full of errors, much noise, degenerate, not well suited to computation</p>
    <p>Must be organized differently than a computation device - 501</p>
    <p>Lower order unorganized dynamics can produce orderliness and high levels of dynamic
      correlations - 501</p>
    <p>Life and sentience deeply interrelated: being sentient is what it feels like to
      be evolution - 502</p>
    <p>Individual neuronal activity is not critical - see Bénard cell formation - 502</p>
    <p>Computational metaphor depends on external interpreter - 502</p>
    <p>Interpretation requires self - something teleodynamic - 503</p>
    <p>Must reconstruct the teleodynamics of thought from its neuronal morphodynamics
      and thermodynamics</p>
    <p>--Caveats</p>
    <p>Interactions between neurons are not merely local, and are far more complex and
      context-sensitive than are simple dynamical interactions.</p>
    <p>Another important caveat is that correlations between neuronal activity patterns
      in different brain regions, and between neuronal activity and extrinsic stimuli,
      are not necessarily reflections of simple causal linkages. They may be artifacts
      of simply being included in some higher-order, network-level morphodynamic process,
      in the same way that causally separated but globally correlated dynamics can emerge
      even in quite separated regions in non-biological morphodynamic processes.</p>
    <p>The road to a scientific theory of sentience, which preserves rather than denies
      its distinctiveness, begins with the recognition of the centrality of its dynamical
      physical foundation. It is precisely by reconstructing the emergence of the teleodynamics
      of thought from its neuronal thermodynamic and morphodynamic foundations that we
      will rediscover the life that computationalism has drained from the science of
      mind.</p>
    
	<h3>From organism to brain - p504</h3>
    <p>Organisms with nervous systems, and particularly those with brains, have evolved
      to augment and elaborate a basic teleodynamic principle that is at the core of
      all life.</p>
    <p>anticipatory sentience&quot; - sentience of the abstract.</p>
    <p>Despite its familiarity, however, starting with the task of trying to explain
      first-person human conscious experience, even with all the wonderful new tools
      of in vivo brain imaging, cellular neuroscience, and human introspection at our
      fingertips, is daunting.</p>
    <p>I believe we can best approach this mystery, as we have successfully approached
      other natural phenomena, by analyzing the physical processes involved, but doing
      so in terms of their emergent dynamics. As with the problem of understanding the
      concept of self, we must start small and work our way upward.</p>
    <p>By grounding our initial analysis of ententional phenomena on a minimal exemplar
      of this emergent shift in dynamicsan autogen we have been able to demystify many
      phenomena that have previously seemed outside the realm of natural science. Perhaps
      starting with an effort to explain the most minimal form of sentience can also
      yield helpful insights into the dynamical basis of this most personal of all mysteries.</p>
    <p>In this way, we may be able to develop some clear criteria for a Turing test of
      sentience.</p>
