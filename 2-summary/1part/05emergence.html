			<blockquote><b>Emergence</b>: A term used to designate an apparently discontinuous transition from one mode of causal properties to another of a higher rank,
			typically associated with an increase in scale in which lower-order component interactions contribute global properties
			that appear irreducible to the lower-order interactions.
			The term has a long and diverse history, but throughout this history it has been used to describe the way
			that living and mental processes depend upon chemical and physical processes,
			yet exhibit collective properties not exhibited by non-living and non-mental processes,
			and in many cases appear to violate the ubiquitous tendencies exhibited by these component interactions.

		<p>The transition from inorganic to organic appears to contravene the the laws of thermodynamics. p143</p>

		<p>For most of the 13 billion years of the universe, the universe has not had ententional properties. p143</p>

		<p>Ententional properties appear to have came out of nowhere. Nevertheless they must have obeyed the laws of physics.</p>

		<p>Emergence: spontaneous novelty / radical unprecedented changes / discontinuities / newness / unpredictable /almost like magic. p143</p>

		<p>Emergence: higher order structure or process arising from lower order. p143</p>

		<p>Harold Morowitz: identified a hierarchy of over twenty 'emergences' of higher order out of smaller/simpler components. p144</p>

		<p>All representations are simplifications. Many transitions are beyond our present capability to represent - therefore remain unpredictable. p145</p>
<!-- clarify:  -->
		<p>Emergent phenomena have distinctive ententional characteristics - that only make sense with respect to non-intrinsic relationships. p146</p>

		<p>Proving ultimate unpredictability or causation is not as important as removing the mysteries/reducing unpredictability (gaps in our knowledge)
			that cause new types of order to emerge. p146</p>

		<p>Emergence appears in the 19th century.
			Darwin's natural selection spurs Herbert Spencer to consider similar principles for psychology and sociology. p147</p>

		<p>Nature became viewed through lens of materialism. Teleology and metaphysics were trashed by science. p147</p>

		<p>But how to explain the evolution of the teleologic nature of life and mental process? p147</p>

<!-- I wish Deacon spent a bit more time or had a clearer explanation here.. -->

		<p>If ententional properties are not already part of the inorganic world, how could such features be derived from or grow out of the inorganic? p147</p>

		<p>Ententional could not be part of foundation [intrinsic] nor could they be denied.</p>

		<p>Emergence: an in-between stage, an intermediate position.</p>

		<p>George Henry Lewes in <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i> (1874-9) first defines emergence.
			Lewes appears to have been influenced by John Stuart Mill/<i>A System of Logic</i> and the discontinuities of chemical reactions.
			The end result being greater/different than the sum of the parts. p147</p>

		<p>Earlier John Locke/late 1600s had accounted for complex ideas arising out of 'atoms' of experience.
			Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck theorize in a similar manner regarding nature. p148</p>

		<p>George Bateson explains how Lamarck turns philosophy inside out:
			The 'Mind at the top' alters from being the explainer of all things to being the thing that needs explaining. p149</p>

		<p>Teleology becomes the result of life, no longer its cause.</p>

		<p>Key event: 1859 Charles Darwin's <i>On the Origin of the Species</i>. p150</p>

		<p>Goal-seeking organisms not required. Teleology may be dispensed with. Natural selection = statistics.</p>

		<p>Functional design can be seen as a law-like process - no magic tricks needed. p150</p>

		<p>Alfred Russel Wallace (co-discoverer of natural selection) and others believed that
			the process of natural selection could be applied to human experience as well. p151</p>

		<p>If something as complex as the human body can arrive at the roll of the dice,
			then why is teleology needed to explain human cognition? p151</p>

		<p>19th century emergentism can be viewed as an effort to rescue human teleology. p152</p>

		<p>Emergentism was a response to another 19th century theory: Reductionism. p151</p>

		<p>Reductionism: complicated phenomena may be be better understood by separating them into component parts. p152</p>

		<p>The whole may be understood as the interaction of the parts. An extension to Atomism - 
			keep dividing things until you get to the smallest possible bit. p152</p>

		<p>But: you never reach the indivisible. There's no stopping it. p152</p>

		<p>Thomas Hobbes: even human interaction may be reduced to the study of bodies in motion. p152</p>

		<p>Robert Wilson: termed the approach 'smallism' the smaller the more fundamental. p153</p>

		<p>Many profound successes: DNA, chemistry, physics, neuroscience... p153</p>

		<p>Not always clear that things become simpler as they become smaller. Things/processes don't always decompose gracefully</p>

		<p>Smallism focuses attention away from interaction complexity. p153</p>

		<p>Provides false impression: analyzing the overall organization may be less important than studying the components. p153</p>

		<p>Recently, according to people like Stephen Hawking, complexity and interaction dynamics have started coming into focus. p153</p>

		<hr>

		<p>British emegentists (Alexander, Broad, Morgan <i>et al</i>): theorize a middle path between reductionism and vitalism. p154</p>

		<p>Influenced by J S Mill: summing up the parts is not good enough. Just look at chemistry where combining two gasses can create a solid. p154</p>

		<p>Must distinguish higher level from lower level properties by non-additive forms of interaction.</p>

		<p>Mill defines homopathic (additive, highly predictable) and heteropathic (bridging, idiosyncratic) laws.
			Higher level properties not discontinuous from lower level, just not predictable using lower level laws. p155</p>

		<p>Morgan: evolution could be more than merely incremental - sometimes there are unprecedented transitions. p156</p>

		<p>Motivation for emergence thinking: explain the gap between hard science excluding ententional and soft science which cannot ignore it. p157</p>

		<p>Alexander and Broad: low level may be the ground for non-mechanistic emergent properties at a higher level. p157</p>

		<p>Broad: Emergence requires an observer. Even with complete description of lower order, one cannot predict higher order. p158</p>

		<p>Alexander: Must accept emergent transitions as fact - despite human limits/current knowledge of inability to explain,
			not because of fundamental incompatibility. Laplaciam demon could predict much but not all. Some transitions are beyond computation. p158</p>

		<p>More questions than answers. Many descriptions but few explanations that derive from first principles. p158</p>

		<p>Strong and weak emergentism. p158</p>

		<p>Note: <i>Incomplete Nature</i> goes beyond current emergent theories.<p>

		<p>Concept of emergence is used in other disciplines: See Weiss/biology and Bertanalaffy. p159</p>

		<p>Roger Sperry, 1980: updates the thinking with a configurational view of emergence. p159</p>

		<p>Example: atoms that happen to be part of a wheel move around more than atoms not part of a wheel.</p>

		<p>Downward causation: being a part in a whole alters the options available, 160</p>

		<p>Comment: Downward causality: like Aristotle's efficient cause
			- important determinant in causality
			- all wrapped in confusion because of simplistic dated thinking will be re-examined later in book in more detail. p161 </p>

		<p>Example: quantum properties swallowed up in transition to higher scale.
			See collapse of SchrÃ¶dinger wave function. p162</p>

		<p>Paul Humphreys: fusion destroys the evidence - parts cease to exist.

		<p>Notion of constraints introduced. p163</p>

		<p>The notion of change in lower-level constraints differs for Sperry's wheel and Humphrey's organism.</p>

		<p>In wheel: invidual mobility of atoms is lost but mass and charge are unaffected. in organism, properties of molecules are altered.</p>

		<p>Two orders of emergent transition described:
		<ol>
			<li>inorganic: whole is the sum of the parts organization. </li>
			<li>organic: exhibit emergence of ententional organisation</li>
		</ol>
			p163
		</p>

		<p>The organic cannot be taken apart and put back together. See Humpty Dumpty. p163</p>

		<p>Issue with emergence theories: possibility of double counting leading to infinite regression: An end result causing itself.</p>

		<p>Jaegwon Kim challenges the popular assumptions of emergentists - forces us to think outside the box. p164</p>

		<p>Kim's critique based on a core issue of emergence: supervenience</p>

		<p>Donald Davidson defines: there cannot be two things that are physically identical but differ in some mental respects.
			Or an object cannot alter some mental respect without altering in some physical aspect. p165</p>

		<p>Or there cannot be a change of thought without a change at the neuronal level. p165</p>

		<p>If so, then every possible higher order property is dependent on a lower order property but then nothing can ever emerge. p165</p>

		<p>No difference in the whole is possible without a difference in the parts.
			Therefore how could there be something in the whole that is not reducible to a combination of properties of the parts? p165</p>

		<p>The part/whole study is critical and has pre-Socratic origins. See also mereology. p165</p>

		<p>Kim uses mereology principle of defining parts and wholes so as to avoid double counting. p165</p>

		<p>No matter how similar the function, form and multiple realizibility - there's always an observable difference. p166</p>

		<p>Substance metaphysics does not support quantum physics. p167</p>
		
		<p>Example: quantum physics: there no 'atoms'/ultimate small particle down there - just quantum fields. p166</p>
		
		<p>At this level features of matter are statistical regularities. p167</p>

		<p>Mereology only begins to succeed at a Newtonian level after statistical regularity of quantum fields have been taken into account.

			Remember this is just an example of failure, not itself leading towards a solution. p167</p>

		<p>Mark Bickhard: to say that particles participate in organization, but are not themselves organized is pointless.
			Particle behavior is process-like and thus by definition organized. p187</p>

		<p>If it's [turtles ;-] organized all the way down, and nothing above can happen without without something below having happened, 
			then how can anything emerge?</p>

		<p>Another issue is synchronicity. Higher order properties were not always present. Life and mind are just about brand new in the universe.
			Emergence is emergent. p168</p>

		<p>Looking at emergence as an ongoing dynamic system helps, so do the many new type of exemplars of emergence as well as new tools. p168</p>

		<p>20th century: two reasons emergence re-emerges: 1. organizations discovered within inorganic phenomena, 2. advent of computer simulations. p168</p>

		<p>Unlikely the former would have received the attention without development of the latter
			because computer controls enabled innumerable iterations upon the substrate enabling quasi-regularities to be identified.</p>

		<p>Graphic representations of such processes enabled a perception of the process by humans. 169</p>

		<p>These computer simulations became interesting in their own right - which led to the emergence of algorithms <i>cellular automata</i>. p170</p>

		<p>Famous 1960s examples: John Conway's <i>Game of Life</i> demos emergence.
			See also work by Stuart Kaufman on connecting cells and Steven Wolfram on physical processes. p170</p>

		<p>The underlying algorithms produce non-linear results, but they are recursive</p>

		<p>The solutions can be mapped out as a phase space - with trajectories of changing values.
			The solutions are not entirely regular but are not entirely chaotic either.</p>

		<p>Trajectories tend to orbit particular zones, such a structure is termed an attractor. p171</p>

		<p>Famous example: Edward Lorenz / 1960s: Lorenz attractor an example of deterministic chaos. 171</p>

		<p>[Disclaimer: This author was romantically attracted to Professor Lorenz's daughter in the 1960s.]</p>

		<p>Spawns many types of investigation: complexity theory, chaos theory, synergetics, complex systems theory and others. p172</p>

		<p>Two have become prominent: 1. genetic algorithms. 2. artificial intelligence.</p>

		<p>These emergent processes are:
		<ul>
			<li>Non-mysterious</li>
			<li>Mechanistic</li>
			<li>Generate spontaneous regularities</li>
			<li>Not dependent on anything extrinsic</li>
			<li>Not a summation of intrinsic components</li>
			<li>Exhibit properties that have no lower-level counterparts</li>
			<li>Exhibit no end directed organization</li>
			<li>Can be described as emergent</li>
			<li>Provide a shift of perspective.</li>
			<li>Uncluttered with historical baggage</li>
			<li>Shifting the term 'emergence' from philosophical term to a more general usage </li>
			<li>Handy as intuition pumps</li>

		<p>Emergence is not a structure but a process. Requires rethink of mereology and supervenience. p174</p>

		<p>Mark Bickhard: Emergence is not because something is composed in a particular way, but because it changes in a particular way.
			If the process of life stops, life stops. p175</p>

		<p>Mind cannot be explained by neurons alone but by the many processes that are occurring - which happen in many regions of the brain. p176</p>
		
		<p>Even the simplest mental activity requires diverse underlying metabolic changes. p176 </p>

		<p>To understand we will need to know the relationships between brain system processes and cognitive thought processes. p176</p>

		<p>Note: Considering brain as process only removes roadblocks - further explaining still needed. p177</p>

		<p>Brain as process removes need for supervenience and mereology.
			Timothy O'Connor: composition not well defined for processes. Dynamics and patterns of change are more important. p177</p>

		<p>Classical emergence: The importance of before and after. Many emergent features have not always been around. p178</p>

		<p>Douglas Hofstader: strange loops: processes dependent on processes dependent on processes. p178</p>

		<p>Dynamic regimes. Higher order nested in lower order. Top/down and bottom/up: both are cool. p179</p>
		
		<p>Is organization merely a description, a simmplification, an abstraction? Is organization epiphenomenal? p179</p>
		
		<p>Emergence is a refutation of reductionism and eliminativism. p179</p>

		<p>Processes are not decomposable to simpler processes. Processes don't have processes as parts. p179</p>

		<p>But dynamic process perspective can take - the spontaneous generation of organization, the breaking of the second law - the ententional into account.
			p180</p>

		<p>All ententional phenomena are defined with respect to order - depend on processes for their existence. 
			The emergence of dynamic regularity out of thermodynamic dis-equilibrium may be the first steps to the emergence of ententional processes. p180</p>
