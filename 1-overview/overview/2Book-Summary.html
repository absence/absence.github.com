	<h2>Book Summary</h2>
	
	<h3>Summary 1: Book Title</h3>
		<p>The most concise possible summary of the book is probably that contained in the second part of the book title:
			<i>Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emereged from Matter</i>.</p>
			
	<h3>Summary 2: Deacon's Words</h3>	
		<p>From page 487 of <i>Incomplete Nature:</i></p>
	
		<blockquote>
			The core hypothesis of this book is that all teleodynamic phenomena necessarily depend upon, and emerge from, simpler morphodynamic and homeodynamic processes. 
			This implies that the complex intentional features that characterize our thoughts and subjective experiences 
			must likewise emerge from a background of neurological morphodynamic and homeodynamic processes. 
		</blockquote>
			
	<h3>Summary 3: Publisher's Words</h3>
	
		<p>From: <a href='http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22328' target='_blank'>http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=22328</a></p>

		<blockquote>A radical new explanation of how life and consciousness emerge from physics and chemistry.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>As physicists work toward completing a theory of the universe and biologists unravel the molecular complexity of life, a glaring incompleteness in this scientific vision becomes apparent. The "Theory of Everything" that appears to be emerging includes everything but us: the feelings, meanings, consciousness, and purposes that make us (and many of our animal cousins) what we are. These most immediate and incontrovertible phenomena are left unexplained by the natural sciences because they lack the physical properties—such as mass, momentum, charge, and location—that are assumed to be necessary for something to have physical consequences in the world. This is an unacceptable omission. We need a "theory of everything" that does not leave it absurd that we exist.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Incomplete Nature begins by accepting what other theories try to deny: that, although mental contents do indeed lack these material-energetic properties, they are still entirely products of physical processes and have an unprecedented kind of causal power that is unlike anything that physics and chemistry alone have so far explained. Paradoxically, it is the intrinsic incompleteness of these semiotic and teleological phenomena that is the source of their unique form of physical influence in the world. Incomplete Nature meticulously traces the emergence of this special causal capacity from simple thermodynamics to self-organizing dynamics to living and mental dynamics, and it demonstrates how specific absences (or constraints) play the critical causal role in the organization of physical processes that generate these properties.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>The book's radically challenging conclusion is that we are made of these specific absenses—such stuff as dreams are made on—and that what is not immediately present can be as physically potent as that which is. It offers a figure/background shift that shows how even meanings and values can be understood as legitimate components of the physical world.</blockquote>
		
	<h3>Summary 4: Yet Another Summary</h3>
		<p>A slightly more explanatory yet concise summary of the book might be:</p>
		
		<p><b><i>Incomplete Nature</i> sets out to resolve Descartes's mind-body problem using the scientific method.</b></p>
		
		<p>This statement may be divided into three parts: the philosophy, the science and the results.
	
	<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-body_problem' target='_blank'>mind-body problem</a> as follows:</p> 
			
			<blockquote>
			The mind–body problem in philosophy examines the relationship between mind and matter, 
			and in particular the relationship between consciousness and the brain. 
			The question, as Colin McGinn puts it, is how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter.
			</blockquote>
		
		<p>The consideration of this problem is ever so old. With <i>cogito ergo sum</i>, 
			Descartes just happened to coin a particularly succinct and memorable phrase for the problem. 
			Any meaningful resolution of the philosophical aspects should take into account the thinking of major philosophical thinkers and tendencies.</p>
		
	<h4>Science</h4>
	
		<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method' target='_blank'>scientific method</a> as follows:</p>
			
			<blockquote>
			The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
			To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
			The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, 
			consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."
			</blockquote>
		
		<p>Any resolution of the scientific aspects of the problem should take into account a gamut of issues 
		- ranging from that thought you just had all the way down to whatever Higg's boson may be in or not in your brain as the case may be. 
		In between, many topics - such as: How do instincts and language arise? How did the inorganic become organic?
		What was there before there was the second law of thermodynamics? How much more is there? -  must be all be totted, tallied and tested.</p>
	
	<h4>Results</h4>
	
		<p>In other words, the purposeful resolution of the mind-body problem should gauge everything we know and value.</p>
	
		<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> is the attempt to appraise the values of what we do know from many sciences and blend these into new methods (standards?) of reckoning.</p>
		
		<p>But wait, wait. There's more!</p>
		
		<p>There's a lot we don't know. There's probably more out there that we cannot measure than that which we can.</p>
		
		<p>So, as Deacon might say, the book is about (w)holes - because there are so many holes in (y)our knowledge.</p> 
		
		<p><i>[or is this Deacon just being holier than thou? ;-]</i></p>
		
		
	<p><i>to be continued...</i></p>
