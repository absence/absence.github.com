     <h2>Chapter 3 ~ Golems</h2> 
     <p><i>Science does not dehumanize man, it de-homunculizes him</i> -B F Skinner, 1971</p>
    <h3>Elimination schemes p80</h3>
    <p>Key words: Eliminative materialism, homuncularize</p>
    
    <p>In our daily life we homuncularize on a regular basis - without thinking. We imagine
      multiple outcomes. We anthropomorphize the inanimate</p>
    
    <p>Even careful theorists do it.</p>
    
    <p>Eliminative materialism is a position that any ententional phenomenon must be
      eliminated from science and replaced by mechanistic methods.</p>
    
    <p>Eliminative materialism sacrifices completeness for consistency</p>
    
    <h3>Heads of the Hydra p82</h3>
    <p>Key words: Daniel Dennet, Homunculi, Marvin Minskey/Society of Mind, Hydra, Hercules,
      fractionation, reducible/decomposable, DNA</p>
    
    <p>An effort to deny ententional processes and reference to teleological phenomena
      in one location only serves to displace these functional roles to other places</p>
    
    <p>A similarity is drawn to Hercules cutting off the head f the Hydra only to have
      two new heads appear.</p>
    
    <p>Eliminative materialism posits that homuncli will go away with further research
      and/or being proved to be fictional to begin with.</p>
    
    <p>Fractionation is a common strategy to reduce comple phenomemena into simpler component
      features</p>
    
    <p>Reducible systems - only depend on ability to identify graininess in complex phenomena
      / capacity to study properties of subdivisions / as distinct from collective phenomenon
      that they compose.</p>
    
    <p>Decomposable systems - additionally requires subdivisions to exhibit properties
      they exhibit in the whole / even if entirely isolated and independent of it.</p>
    
    <p>A clock is both reducible and decomposable to its parts, whereas a living organism
      may be analytically reducible, but it is not decomposable.</p>
    
    <p>While ententional phenomena are dependent on physical substrate relationships,
      they are not decomposable to them, only to lower-order ententional phenomena.</p>
    
    <p>This is because although ententional phenomena are necessarily physical, their
      proper parts are not physical parts.</p>
    
    <h3>Dead truth p86</h3>
    <p>Key words: golem, robot, homunculus, zombie, Frankenstein, logic, containment,
      Alan Turing, Turing machine, Gregory Bateson, Kurt Godel, incompleteness theorems</p>
    
    <p>homunculus: an avatar of cryptic ententional properties smuggled into our theories</p>
    <p>Golem as the avatar of its opposite: apparently mindlike processes that are nonetheless
      devoid of their own ententional properties.</p>
    
    <p>If a homunculus is a little man in my head, then the golem is a hollow-headed
      man, a zombie.</p>
    
    <p>A golem is often prposed as a reductio ad absurdum of a thoroughly eliminative
      materialism view.</p>
    
    <p>Vast majority of our moment-to-moment behaviors - including belies, desires and
      purposes - are not associated with consciousness - and is thus zombie/golem-like</p>
    
    <p>Besides being a soulless being, following commands with mechanical dispassion,
      the golem lacks discernment.</p>
    
    <p>The golems of today are not artificial living beings, but rather bureaucracies,
      legal systems, and computers. In their design as well as their role as unerringly
      literal slaves, digital computers are the epitome of a creation that embodies truth
      maintenance made animate.</p>
    
    <p>Computers are logic embodied in mechanism. The development of logic was the result
      of reflection on the organization of human reasoning processes. It is not itself
      thought, however, nor does it capture the essence of thought, namely, its quality
      of being about something. Logic is only the skeleton of thought: syntax without
      semantics.</p>
    
    <p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
      a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
      choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by
      necessity preformed.</p>
    
    <p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
      a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
      choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by
      necessity preformed.</p>
    
    <p>This logico-mathematical-machine equivalence was formalized in reverse when Alan
      Turing showed how, in principle, every valid mathematical operation that could
      be precisely defined and carried out in a finite number of steps could also be
      modeled by the actions of a machine.</p>
    
    <p>To simplify a bit, the problem lies in the very assumption that syntax and semantics,
      logic and representation, are independent of one another. A golem is syntax without
      semantics and logic without representation. There is no one at home in the golem
      because there is no representation possible no meaning, no significance, no value,
      just physical mechanism, one thing after another with terrible inflexible consistency.</p>
    
    <p>We might suspect, then, that whenever we encounter a golem, there is a hidden
      homunculus, a man behind the curtain, or a rabbi and his magical incantations pulling
      the nearly invisible strings.</p>
