	<h2>Chapter 3 ~ GOLEMS</h2> 
		<p><i>Science does not dehumanize man, it de-homunculizes him</i> &mdash; B F Skinner, 1971</p>

		<p><i>
		This chapter:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Science so reduces and fragments that it eliminates the ententional, the life</li>
			<li>If the homunculus can be taken to represent the mind, then the golem represents the body</li>
			<li>Bureaucracies, computers and the things that living people make are golems</li>
			<li>None of these have an intrinsic ability to evolve, to increase in complexity</li>
			<li>The only thing that does increase and evolve, is buggy, messy living matter</li>

			<blockquote>In Jewish folklore, a golem is an animated anthropomorphic being, created entirely from inanimate matter. 
				The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing.

		<p>In our daily life we homuncularize on a regular, natural basis - without thinking. </p>
			
<!--
How do homuncularize and abstracting relate to each other?
-->			

		<p>We imagine multiple outcomes. We anthropomorphize the inanimate. p80</p>
		
		<p>We homuncularize without thinking. Even careful theorists do it... p80</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism: the position that any ententional phenomenon are merely heuristic place holders 
			and can/must be eliminated from science and replaced by mechanistic methods.</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism tends to sacrifice completeness for consistency - misses out on all the ententional aspects. p81</p>

		<p>Daniel Dennet: An effort to deny ententional processes and reference to teleological phenomena
			in one location only serves to displace these functional roles to other places. p81</p>
		
		<p>Homunculi are stand-ins for incomplete explanations. p81</p>

		<p>Example: homuculi become little men becomes <i>&eacute;lan vital</i>. p82</p>
		
		<p>A similarity is drawn to Hercules cutting off the head of the Hydra only to have
		two new heads appear. p82</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism posits that homuncli will go away with further research
			and/or being proved to be fictional to begin with. p83</p>

		<p>Fractionation is a common strategy to reduce complex phenomena into simpler component features</p>

		<!--
		Interesting insight begins here. Interestingly, it's only used here and and not used again later in the book.
		-->
		<p>Reducible systems - only depend on ability to identify graininess in complex phenomena
			/ capacity to study properties of subdivisions / as distinct from collective phenomenon
			that they compose. p85</p>

		<p>Decomposable systems - additionally requires subdivisions to exhibit properties
			they exhibit in the whole / even if entirely isolated and independent of it. p85</p>

		<p>A clock is both reducible and decomposable to its parts, whereas a living organism
			may be analytically reducible, but it is not decomposable. p85</p>

		<p>While ententional phenomena are dependent on physical substrate relationships,
			they are not decomposable to them, only to lower-order ententional phenomena. p85</p>

		<p>This is because although ententional phenomena are necessarily physical, their
			proper parts are not physical parts. p85</p>
		
		<p>In dividing our problems into smaller bits, we multiply the mysteries. p86</p>

		<p>Homunculus: an avatar of cryptic ententional properties smuggled into our theories, p86</p>
		
		<p>Golem as the avatar of its opposite: apparently mindlike processes that are nonetheless
			devoid of their own ententional properties. p86</p>

		<p>If a homunculus is a little man in my head, then the golem is a hollow-headed man, a zombie. p86</p>

		<p>A golem is often proposed as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a thoroughly eliminative materialism view. p87</p>

		<p>Vast majority of our moment-to-moment behaviors - including belies, desires and
			purposes - are not associated with consciousness - and is thus zombie/golem-like<. p87/p>

		<p>Besides being a soulless being, following commands with mechanical dispassion, the golem lacks discernment. p88</p>

		<p>The golems of today are not artificial living beings, but rather bureaucracies,
			legal systems, and computers. In their design as well as their role as unerringly
			literal slaves, digital computers are the epitome of a creation that embodies truth
			maintenance made animate. p89</p>

		<p>Computers are logic embodied in mechanism. Logic is only the skeleton of thought: syntax without semantics. p89</p>

		<p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
			a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
			choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by necessity preformed. p89</p>

		<p>This logico-mathematical-machine equivalence was formalized in reverse when Alan
			Turing showed how, in principle, every valid mathematical operation that could
			be precisely defined and carried out in a finite number of steps could also be
			modeled by the actions of a machine. p90</p>

		<p>To simplify a bit, the problem lies in the very assumption that syntax and semantics,
			logic and representation, are independent of one another. A golem is syntax without
			semantics and logic without representation. There is no one at home in the golem
			because there is no representation possible no meaning, no significance, no value,
			just physical mechanism, one thing after another with terrible inflexible consistency. p92</p>

		<p>We might suspect, then, that whenever we encounter a golem, there is a hidden
			homunculus, a man behind the curtain, or a rabbi and his magical incantations pulling
			the nearly invisible strings. p93</p>

		<hr>

		 <p>60's Behaviorism movement almost killed psychology. Thoughts and experiences: taboo. 
			But this was first systematic approach to slaying the homunculus fallacy by replacing notions with observations. p93</p>
		 
		 <p>70's Cognitive science - mixes psychology, philosophy, computation <i>et al</i> - treats mental processes as vast array of computer algorithms. 
			But finds no place for consciousness - heck, consciousness might not even exist. p94</p>
		 
		<p>Thus, if scientists could map every possible human thought or action to an equivalent computer circuit or algorithm, 
			wouldn't this be good enough? p94</p>
			
		<p>The implication: For any mental operation it should be possible to derive a corresponding mechanical operation. 
			Therefore ideas can have a physical consequence. And teleology can be embodied. 
			Thus we can dispense with teleology and focus on the physics. p96</p>

		<p>Computation is an idealization about cognition based on an idealization about physical processes. p104</p>
