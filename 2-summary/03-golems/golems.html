<h2>Chapter 3 ~ Golems</h2> 
    <p><i>Science does not dehumanize man, it de-homunculizes him</i> -B F Skinner, 1971</p>
  <h3>Elimination schemes - p80</h3>
    <p>Key words: 
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism' target='_blank'>Eliminative materialism</a>, 
    homuncularize, 
    [page:Ententional Ententional]</p>

    <p>In our daily life we homuncularize on a regular basis - without thinking. We imagine
    multiple outcomes. We anthropomorphize the inanimate.</p>

    <p>Even careful theorists do it... p80</p>

    <p>Eliminative materialism: the a position that any ententional phenomenon must be
    eliminated from science and replaced by mechanistic methods.</p>

    <p>Eliminative materialism tends to sacrifices completeness for consistency - missing out on all the ententianal aspects. p81</p>

  <h3>Heads of the Hydra - p82</h3>
    <p>Key words: 
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennet' target='_blank'>Daniel Dennet</a>, Homunculi, 
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&Eacute;lan vital' target='_blank'>&Eacute;lan vital</a>,

    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules' target='_blank'>Hercules</a>,
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minskey' target='_blank'>Marvin Minskey</a>/Society of Mind, 
    Eliminative materialism,

    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(philosophy)' target='_blank'>reducible/decomposable[Reduction]</a>, 
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA' target='_blank'>DNA</a></p>

    <p>Daniel Dennet: An effort to deny ententional processes and reference to teleological phenomena
    in one location only serves to displace these functional roles to other places</p>

    <p>Example: homuculi become little men becomes </i>&eacute;lan vital</i></p>
    
    <p>A similarity is drawn to Hercules cutting off the head of the Hydra only to have
    two new heads appear.</p>

    <p>Eliminative materialism posits that homuncli will go away with further research
    and/or being proved to be fictional to begin with.</p>

    <p>Fractionation is a common strategy to reduce comple phenomemena into simpler component
    features</p>

    <p>Reducible systems - only depend on ability to identify graininess in complex phenomena
    / capacity to study properties of subdivisions / as distinct from collective phenomenon
    that they compose.</p>

    <p>Decomposable systems - additionally requires subdivisions to exhibit properties
    they exhibit in the whole / even if entirely isolated and independent of it.</p>

    <p>A clock is both reducible and decomposable to its parts, whereas a living organism
    may be analytically reducible, but it is not decomposable.</p>

    <p>While ententional phenomena are dependent on physical substrate relationships,
    they are not decomposable to them, only to lower-order ententional phenomena.</p>

    <p>This is because although ententional phenomena are necessarily physical, their
    proper parts are not physical parts.</p>

    <p>Homunculus: an avatar of cryptic ententional properties smuggled into our theories</p>
    <p>Golem as the avatar of its opposite: apparently mindlike processes that are nonetheless
    devoid of their own ententional properties.</p>

    <p>If a homunculus is a little man in my head, then the golem is a hollow-headed
    man, a zombie.</p>

    <p>A golem is often prposed as a reductio ad absurdum of a thoroughly eliminative
    materialism view.</p>

    <p>Vast majority of our moment-to-moment behaviors - including belies, desires and
    purposes - are not associated with consciousness - and is thus zombie/golem-like</p>

    <p>Besides being a soulless being, following commands with mechanical dispassion,
    the golem lacks discernment.</p>

    <p>The golems of today are not artificial living beings, but rather bureaucracies,
    legal systems, and computers. In their design as well as their role as unerringly
    literal slaves, digital computers are the epitome of a creation that embodies truth
    maintenance made animate.</p>

    <p>Computers are logic embodied in mechanism. The development of logic was the result
    of reflection on the organization of human reasoning processes. It is not itself
    thought, however, nor does it capture the essence of thought, namely, its quality
    of being about something. Logic is only the skeleton of thought: syntax without
    semantics.</p>

    <p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
    a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
    choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by
    necessity preformed.</p>

    <p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
    a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
    choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by
    necessity preformed.</p>

    <p>This logico-mathematical-machine equivalence was formalized in reverse when Alan
    Turing showed how, in principle, every valid mathematical operation that could
    be precisely defined and carried out in a finite number of steps could also be
    modeled by the actions of a machine.</p>

    <p>To simplify a bit, the problem lies in the very assumption that syntax and semantics,
    logic and representation, are independent of one another. A golem is syntax without
    semantics and logic without representation. There is no one at home in the golem
    because there is no representation possible no meaning, no significance, no value,
    just physical mechanism, one thing after another with terrible inflexible consistency.</p>

    <p>We might suspect, then, that whenever we encounter a golem, there is a hidden
    homunculus, a man behind the curtain, or a rabbi and his magical incantations pulling
    the nearly invisible strings.</p>

     <p>60's Behaviorism movement almost killed psychology. Thoughts and experiences: taboo. 
     But was first systematic approach to slaying the homunculus fallacy by replacing notions with observations</p>
     <p>70's Cognitive science - mixes psychology, philosophy, compution <i>et al</i> - treats mental procsses as vast array of computer algorithms. 
     But finds no place for consciousness - heck, consciousness might not even exist.</p>
     <p>Thus, if scientists could map every possible human thought or action to an eqivalent computer circuit or algorithm, wouldn't this be good enough?</p>

    <p>Computational theory of mind: the manipulation of tokens completely describes thinking.</p>
    <p>Alogrith: a set of instructions to generate a process that achieves a particularr consequence.</p>
    <p>But don't specify all the details. Just like words on this pae - there needs to be an interpreter.</p>
    <p>Consider Gary Kasparov playing chess against the computer Big Blue. Big Blue is but a collection of homuculi - human thoughts stored in a box. 
    It resembles the unconscious more than the conscious.</p>
    <p>Is the human mind ultimately just a computer? ...</p>
    <p>But, if so, how did it learn? How can 'simple' become more 'complex'? How did it evolve?</p>
    <p>And when and how does cognition come into the process? </p>
    <p>Note that cognition has to be intrinsic/come from with - not extrinsic/come from the ouside.</p>
    <p>Computer bugs provide a clue. The process of maintaining/surving as yet unknown errors may provide some clues.</p>
    <p>Computers made of meat (us) are messy and imprecise. Just what the doctor ordered.</p>
