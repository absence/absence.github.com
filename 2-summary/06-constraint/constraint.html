    <h2>Chapter 6 ~ Constraint</h2> 
    <p>realism: general are fundementals / nominalism: generals are epiphenomenal</p> 
    <p>You can reduce, but you cannot unreduce</p> 
    <h3>Habits - p182</h3> 
    <p>Key words: emergent transition, Charles Sanders Peirce, tychism, habit, realism,
      Plato, realism/nominalism, entelechy, William of Occam, Occam's razor, reductionist,
      individuation, extension,</p> 
    <p>-- Peirce's habits - realism/nominalism - Peirce is a realist. D: some form of
      realism must hold</p> 
    <h3>Redundancy - p186</h3> 
    <p>Key words: redundancy,</p> 
    <p>Redundancy: repetition of similar events. Mental events also depend on physical
      processes. something must exist in order that a one thing can attribute a tendency
      to another.</p> 
    <h3>More similar = less different - p189</h3> 
    <p>Key words: constraint, W Ross Ashby, Michael Polanyi, DNA, Kolmogorov complexity,
      Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, complexity theory</p> 
    <p>focus on what us not there. difference is the opposite of similarity. similarity
      is fewer differences. fewer implies quantitative not qualitative. can be defined
      without regard to form or model or without specifying which difference are reduced.
      constraints are what is not there but could have been, irrespective of whether
      this is registered by an act of observation.</p> 
    <p>constraints can be extrinsic or intrinsic. p 192</p> 
    <p>this chapter goal: what is absent has causal power of organization and asymetric
      dynamics of physical or loving process</p> 
    <p>constraint is reduced variety, therefore there will be more redundancy (repetition
      of similar events) in attributes.</p> 
    <p>What does not have three points - leaves all the triangle</p> 
    <p>What is not a girl + ??</p> 
    <p>look in the sky. the constraint is &quot;it is not red&quot;. What's left? Mars.</p> 
    <p>what does not have two hands, has not drowned escaping from Alcatraz.</p> 
    <p>what is not made by a company other than hp, has an id that is not different than
      xd111222333xyz.</p> 
    <h3>Concrete abstraction - p197</h3> 
    <p>Key words: Humphrey, concept of fusion, Philip Anderson, &quot;more is different',
      Robert Laughlin, protected states, constraint propogation, realist/nominalist,
      emergence</p> 
    <p>Can constraints cause things?</p> 
    <p>What something does not exhibit, it cannot impose on something else via interaction??</p> 
    <p>where there is no difference, it can cause no difference p197</p> 
    <p>two cases of dynamical conditions:</p> 
    <p>microscopic cause little change to macroscopic - near-equilibrium thermodynamic
      processes</p> 
    <p>microscopic can cause change to macroscopic - persistent far-from equilibrium
      thermodynamic processes</p> 
    <p>Here look at 1 only. 2 in chapter 8</p> 
    <p>component micro interactions: faster than interactions with systems</p> 
    <p>return to stable near-equilibrium much faster</p> 
    <p>highest probability will correlate with most redundant effects</p> 
    <p>fluctuations cancel each other out</p> 
    <p>most generalized attractor features end up have causal influence.</p> 
    <p>only most redundant features manifest at higher level</p> 
    <p>see also Humphreys' fusion, Mill's account of chemical properties, Anderson's
      &quot;More is different&quot;</p> 
    <p>bottom-up notion of causality is limited p201</p> 
    <p>reduction of options at one level can lead to an even greater reduction of options
      in a process that depends on the first</p> 
    <p>emergence are not something added, but a reduction of options, restrictions and/or
      hidden via ascent in scale p 202</p> 
    <h3>Nothing is irreducible - p203</h3> 
    <p>Key words irreducible, multiple-realizibility</p>
