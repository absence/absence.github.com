     <h2>Chapter 15 ~ Self</h2> 
    <h3>Starting small - p 463</h3>
    <p>Descartes simplifies in Cogito ergo sum...</p>
    <p>Selves evolve, develop, differentiate, change. Selves mature slowly, differentiate
      incrementally. Selves are the cause and consequence of the maturation process</p>
    <p>took billions of years to evolve. product of astronomical number of processes
      taking place in millesecond timeframe</p>
    <p>complex variant of counter-intuitive process</p>
    <p>dazzling process. not easy to understand.</p>
    <p>best to start with small</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt; life/organisms/selves are self-maintaining, self-organizing, self-reproducing</p>
    <p>self is what defines the living organism - maintenance and perpetuation - self-referential
      and self-projecting</p>
    <p>the functions and adaptations of an organism are for individuation or reproduction</p>
    <p>organisms as small as bacteria qualify as selves</p>
    <p>end-directness is intrinsic</p>
    <p>emergence of self that characterizes human subjectivity is much more recent</p>
    <h3>Individuation - p467</h3>
    <p>reflective individuation - teleodynamic process that is closed with respect to
      other dynamical features of the world</p>
    <p>the whole is represented and reflected in the part</p>
    <p>component functions contribute to the whole. the whole is required to generate
      component functions</p>
    <p>whole/part inextricably tangled</p>
    <p>mental self is a higher order of self - at same time subordinate to the organism
      self</p>
    <p>organisms are materially bounded. but in addition their boundedness is intrinsic
      to their dynamics</p>
    <p>while biological self and other are commonly distinguishable on either side of
      some physical interface - a membrane, cell wall, or skin - these are only convenient
      means of physically embodying this otherwise purely dynamical distinction.</p>
    <h3>Selves made of selves - p469</h3>
    <p>When we reach the level of a human subjective self, even the concept of boundary
      makes no sense, despite the fact that the reflexive closure of subjectivity is
      unambiguous.</p>
    <p>as organisms become more complex, cell-level dynamical reciprocity simplified,
      intercellular reciprocity increases.</p>
    <p>dynamic not skin/bark</p>
    <p>specialized bounding surfaces, selectively permeable</p>
    <p>our attention is drawn to boundary surfaces, but the self was already there</p>
    <p>soma cells codependently parasitic</p>
    <p>cells can't reproduce</p>
    <p>duplication shifted to whole organism</p>
    <p>lichens</p>
    <p>mitochondria</p>
    <p>teleogen</p>
    <p>teleogenic units can conflict</p>
    <p>multiple orders of self-built-upon-self</p>
    <p>lower-level degradation - reduced functionality of compoenents</p>
    <p>modularity - mature teleodynamics</p>
    <p>highly distributed</p>
    <p>termites - only queen reproduces</p>
    <p>self - highly diaphanous</p>
    <p>brains mediate between organism and outside world</p>
    <p>brain mediates using dynamics of self itself</p>
    <h3>Neuronal self - p474</h3>
    <p>we worry about death</p>
    <p>its about self-preservation</p>
    <p>physiology - homeostasis, signalling, reproducing</p>
    <p>brain: critical mediator</p>
    <p>vegetative self: triply embodied</p>
    <p>internal/external mediator</p>
    <p>generates virtual worlds - representations</p>
    <p>simulating consequences</p>
    <p>predictive and projective</p>
    <p>intrinsically recursive</p>
    <h3>Self-differentiation - p476</h3>
    <p>self: process of differentiation</p>
    <p>moment-by-moment sense of self - continuous - seconds</p>
    <p>takes time to wake up - for self to organize itself</p>
    <p>The unity of waking conscious experience may in this respect be a special case
      of a more pluralistic self-differentiation process.</p>
    <h3>The locus of agency - p478</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most enigmatic feature of self is its role as agent: as the locus
      and initiator of non-spontaneous physical changes in the world around it.</p>
    <p>An agent is a locus of work that is able to change things in ways more concordant
      with internally generated ends and contrary to extrinsic tendencies.</p>
    <p>self-agency defined in terms of constraints</p>
    <p>self-perpetuating constraints create capacity to create self-promoting work</p>
    <p>generation of interactive constraints which do work to perpetuate reciprocal maintenance
      of constraints that maintain organism self</p>
    <p>The ability to produce highly diverse and yet precise constraints-absences-thus
      makes possible a nearly unlimited capacity for selves to intervene in the goings-on
      of the natural world.</p>
    <h3>Evolution's answer to nominalism - p480</h3>
    <p>generalities and similarity classes are merely mental constructions, due to a
      necessary simplification that is implicit in the nature of mental representation.</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt; radical simplification</p>
    <p>Both organism adaptations and mental representations necessarily ignore vastly
      many physical properties of things, fail to generate distinctions that correspond
      to physical differences, and lump together phenomena into general types for what
      might be described as pragmatic reasons. &gt;&gt; categorical fallibility</p>
    <p>Brains have elaborated this causal realism to an extreme, and minds capable of
      symbolic references can literally bring even the most Platonic of conceptions of
      abstract forms into the realm of causal particulars.</p>
    <p>p483 &gt;&gt; how about adding to list of properties that are incidental to the
      work that results?? Plants grow towards light. Artificial sweeteners treated as
      sugar...</p>
    <p>human minds can literally transform arbitrarily created abstract general features
      into causally efficacious specific physical events.</p>
    <h3>The extentionless cogito - p483</h3>
    <p>self-perspective is a circular dynamic, an incessant transformation</p>
    <p>Individuation and agency are intrinsic features of the teleodynamics that brains
      have evolved to generate, because of the dynamical closure, constraint generation,
      and self-maintenance that defines teleodynamics.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, this view of self shows it to be as non-material as Descartes might
      have imagined, and yet as physical, extended, and relevant to the causal scheme
      of things as is the hole at the hub of a wheel.</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt; both non-material and physical</p>
