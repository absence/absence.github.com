     <h2>Chapter 9 ~ Teleodynamics</h2> 
    <h3>A common dynamical thread - p264</h3>
    <p>Key words: second law of thermodynamics, evolotion, non-living / living, Erwin
      Shrodinger, Manfred Eigen, Prigogine, Roderick Dewar, A Kleidon, Teleodynamics</p>
    <p>This chapter: Is there more to life tham homeodynamics and morphodynamics? - 264</p>
    <p>Yet another dynamocally sepervenient transition: teleodynamics - p265</p>
    <p>Organisms</p>
    <p>= incessantly engaged in creating and maintaining order</p>
    <p>= require constant throughput of energy and materials</p>
    <p>Give possibility of working against second law of thermodynamics</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>On the non-living side, we find processes that</p>
    <p>(a) have wide generality in their dynamical tendencies;</p>
    <p>(b) are describable with good predictive power by fairly simple dynamical equations
      or statistical methods;</p>
    <p>(c) exhibit higher-order aggregate properties that can typically be extrapolated
      from properties of their components in interaction; and</p>
    <p>(d) exhibit a tendency to dissipate constraints, simplify complex interdependencies,
      and redistribute free energy in ways that decrease any capacity to do work.</p>
    <p>On the living side, we find processes that</p>
    <p>(a) consistently partition thermodynamic processes so that many component processes
      follow trajectories that run radically counter to global thermodynamic probabilities;</p>
    <p>(b) are highly heterogeneous in their structures and dynamics;</p>
    <p>(c) produce processes/behaviors that are so convoluted, divergent, and idiosyncratic
      as to defy compact algorithmic description;</p>
    <p>(d) generate and maintain aggregate systemic properties that are quite distinct
      from properties of any component;</p>
    <p>(e) reflect the effects of deep historical contingencies that may no longer be
      existent in their present context.</p>
    <p>- p267</p>
    <p>Teleodynamics</p>
    <p>= a dynamical form of organization that promotes its own persistence and maintenance
      by modifying this dynamics to more effectively utilize supportive extrinsic conditions.</p>
    <p>= not identifiable with any particular constituents, or even any constituent morphodynamic
      process.</p>
    <p>= organized with respect to its own persistence</p>
    <p>= not bound to specific material substrates or component dynamical process</p>
