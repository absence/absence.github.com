	<h2>Chapter 0 ~ Absence</h2> 
	<p><em>In the history of culture, the discovery of zero will always stand out as one of the greatest single achievements of the human race. —Tobias Dantzig, 1930</em> </p> 
		<h3>1 The missing cipher - p1</h3> 
			<p>Key words: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything" target="_blank" title="">Theory of Everything</a>,
			  [page:Absential Absential],</p> 
<!--			
			<p>Deacon lays down the proposed rules of engagement with traditional philosophy and the scientific methos.</p> 
-->
			<p>The current scientific <em>Theory of Everything</em> is implies that: &quot;we don’t exist, except as collections of atoms.&quot;</p> 
			
			<p>Consider the sentences you are now reading:
				The meaning is not in the squiggles, not in the sounds made, not even in the neurons being fired in your brain</p>
				
			<p>These sentences lacks the properties that normally cause things to happen. 
				Information has no mass, momentum, charge, no solidity, no presence of any sense.
				Moreover these sentences could even be nonsense and have no correspondence to reality. 
				Nevertheless if that nonsense caused you to wonder, it could still influence the way you act.
				</p>	
			
			<p>Despite the surreal aspects, These sentences were written to convey a meaning. 
			And you are expending effort in order to receive this information.</p>
			
			<p>Thus, there's something not-there there. And what is not there may have physical consequences.</p> 
			
			<p>What is absent matters. Longings, desires, passion, appetite, mourning, aspiration 
			are all ideas about things not present or that don't exist and have no physical attributes - but these are the stuff of life.</p>
			
			<p>A shovel is not just a shovel. And it's not a hole in the ground. Yet it is a method of creating holes more easily.</p>
			
			<p>A defining property of life and mind, a causal role for absence seems to be absent from the natural sciences.</p> 
			
			<p>Definition [page:Absential Absential] features: phenomena whose existence are determined with respect to an essential absence.</p> 
			
			<p>A complete theory of the world must make sense of what is not there and how that affects what is there.</p>

			<p><i>This section: 19th C begins to see the world materialistically. Late 20th C see failure to complete on consciousness. 
				Are we lft with Descarte. Is an observer is still required? 
				Incomplete Nature will argure that consciousness - non-material phenomena, absent from the physical world - may have causal, physical results.
				<br>Disciplines included: philosopny, biology, mathematics, cognitive science</i></p>
				
			<p>Most of science focuses on the things that are actual and present.</p>

			<p>Inorganic things tend to fall into disorder. 
				When confronted by things that become 'organized' -  a non-actual, non-physical trait -  people have historically tended to ascribe them to a 'designer'.</p>
				
			<p>In 19th C: Darwin postulates organization without a designer: natural selection. 
				People begin to ovserve numerous self-organizing inorganic processes. 
				Scholars could believe the entire gamut of organic and mental process could be described mechanistically in non-absential terms. 
				The book is built upon such work. There are, however, caveats...</p>
		
			<p>Example: dynamical systems [an area of mathematics used to describe the behavior of complex dynamical systems, usually by employing differential equations or difference equations.]:
			limited because whatever causes an energetic difference must be seen to exist.</p>
			
			<p>Beginning 1980s, Bateson, von Foerster, Maturana, Varela <i>et al</i> start to see that dynamical systems could not be universal.</p>
			
			<p>Maturana and Varela (1980): develop concept of <i>autopoesis</i> - self-creating dynamics. 
				But this takes too much for granted. Requires an observer. Does not account for the absential.</p>
			
			<p>Thus Descarte's mind-body problem continues. Something is still missing.</p> 
			
			<p>Materialism [the only thing that exists is matter or energy] cannot hold true here.</p>
			
			<p>David Chalmers: the emergence of experience goes beyond what can be derived from physics.</p>
			
			<p>Consciousness is what is left after you take away all the physical bits.</p>
			
			<p>Tenet of the book: Consciousness may not be there, but it can still be materially, causally efficacious.</p>
			
			<p>Not only does consciousness remains unaccounted for. So does 'me'.</p>
