2013-04-10 ~ I need to decide if this chapter is primarily about the natural selection of functions.

And, if so, adjust the woeding accordingly and learn more about the biological differences between forms and functions.

	<h2>Chapter 4 ~ Teleonomy</h2>

		<p><i>Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.</i> &mdash; J B S Haldane
		</p>

		<p>From the <i>Incomplete Nature</i> glossary:</p>
		
		<blockquote>Teleonomy (Teleonomic): Teleological in name only. A terminological distinction that would exemplify a middle ground between mere mechanism and purpose, 
			behavior predictably oriented toward a particular target state even in systems 
			where there was no explicit representation of that state or intention to achieve it </blockquote>
			
		<blockquote>Teleological (Teleology): Purposive, or end-directed (the study of such relationships). 
			Philosophically related to Aristotle’s concept of a “final cause” </blockquote>	

		<p>From Wikipedia: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology' target='_blank'>Teleology</a>:</p>
			<blockquote>is any philosophical account that holds that final causes exist in nature, meaning that design and purpose analogous 
				to that found in human actions are inherent also in the rest of nature.</blockquote>

		<p>recap- Rudolf Clausius/1865: Entropy - the tendency in nature for things to fall apart. p107</p>
		
		<p>description- Second law of thermodynamics: all other things being equal: entropy will go for broke. p107</p>
		
		<p>description- Thus: Life and thinking - order and organization - are quite unnatural and appear to violate a universal law. p108</p>
		
		<p>observation- Loophole: Second law is a tendency - but not a necessity. There's room to wiggle here. p108</p>
		
		<p>observation- In life: Time reversal appears implicit as is Aristotle's 'final cause'. p108</p>
		
		<p>observation- an organism implies ongoing increasing of complexity that counters the incessant messiness of entropy. 
			Yet, future events are not causing prsent events. </p>
		<p>question- So what could possibly be causing organisms to appear? p109</p>

		<p>description- The production of orderlines - localized opposition to the second law of thermodynamics 
			- is what distinguishes life from inorganic processes. p109</p>
		
		<p>description- The processes produced by organisms are not mere tendencies, but can be termed as <i>functions</i>. p110</p>
		
		<p>description- We know of functions as part of the process of design. Darwin taught us that functions may emerge spontaneously. p110</p>

		<p>recap-  The logic of natural selection defeats claims that teleogy is necessary to explain complexity of biology. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Daniel Dennet: natural selection is the universal acid. p110</p>
		
		<p>observation- Theory of natural selection = statistics. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin: How odo rganisms become suited to their environment:
			<ol>
				<li>reproduce,</li>
				<li>diverge</li>
				<li>produce surfeit</li>
			</ol>
		p110</p>
		
		<p>recap- Darwin: Process generates inequalities. Differs with Lamarck's inheritance of acquired characteristics. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin's discovery/<i>Descent of Man</i>: logic of natural selection is the <i>after-the-fact</i> logic p111. 
			Favorable outcomes preferentially reproduced, retained or expressed.
			How these are generated matters not. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Edward Thorndike's 'Law of Effect': organisms adapt their behavior to their environment. p111</p>

		<p>observation- Why did it take so long to discover? Humans are designers. 
			Maybe because it is easier to think there's a supreme designer than to intuit the spontaneity. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Empedocles: orderliness may arrive spontaneously - by preserved accident. 
			Only combinations that produce balance/fitness likely to persist and produce progeny. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Aristotle disses Empedocles. How could the order and beauty we see be merely accidental? There's an <i>entelechy</i> lurking. p113</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin's thoughts: provoked by Malthus, supervene Larmarck. p113</p>
		
		<p>recap- Darwin: Mechanisms for reproducing and preserving forms and functions are entirely separable. p113</p>

		<p>recap- Jacques Monod's <i>Chance and Necessity</i>: all of natural science [systems of molecular biology] 
			may be explained without final causality or teleological processes. p114</p>

		<p>comparison- Machines require assembly. Organisms develop spontaneously. Though they appear similar, they are opposites. p114</p>
<!--
Insert pretty table here comparing organisms and machines
-->
		<p>recap- Ernst Mayer/1974: we can avoid confusing the asymmertic avtivities - by distinguishing the variations. 
			Nonetheless all can be understood as thoroughly mechanistic - an exception: life itself. p115</p>

		<p>recap- Van Quine: Darwin shows that nature needs no Aristotelean final cause - she can be explained merely by physics and chemistry. p115</p>

		<p>recap: Colin Pittendrigh/1958: coins <i>teleonomy</i>: law-like behavior, asymmetric, predictive. p115</p>

		<p>observation: A mechanical process can be organized so it converges towards a specific state. 
			Note: This is NOT behavior for the the sake of the end state.</p>

		<p>assertion: Teleonomy: target-directed, but behavior agnostic, consequence-blind, accident-driven</p>

		<p>observation: Teleonomy: itself an accident, a mechanism.</p>

		<p>example- the thermostat (in a Bateson-like manner): it behaves precisely how a purpose-driven human would behave. p116</p>

		<p>example- Old Faithful: shows a teleonomic mechanism can arise by accident. p117</p>

		<p>observation- Thus: it/we/them may all be an accident. p117</p>

		<p>example- consider human body temperature regulation: similar to thermostat, maintains a temperature. p118</p>

		<p>description- Body temperature is not just any arbitrary temperature, 
			it is the most suitable temperature for a variety of metabolic processes to operate optimally.
			Target is extrinsic. Not accidental like old Faithfull. p118</p>
			
		<p>outcome- But utlitimately body temperature is most successful surviving variant. p118</p>	

		<p>recap- Mayr: 'A teleonomic process or behavior is one which owes its goal-directedness to the operation of the program.' p119</p>
		
		<p>observation- Use of word 'program' is important. because denotes algorithms of any level of complexity. p119</p>

		<p>caveat- But do not confuse an extrinsic abstract description with something that is intrinsic. p120</p>

		<p>recap- Mayr: Teleomatic: asymmetric, end-directed, in a passive automatic way, regulated by external forces or conditions. p120</p>

		<p>observation- Teleology, teleonomic, teleomatic: now widely accepted. p121</p>

		<p>question- But which is the cause: human design, natural selection or happy accident? p122</p>
		
		<p>define- <ii>telos</> An ultimate object or aim. p122</p>

		<p>description- Many adaptive features, embedded in an organism, exist because of the contribution to something else. p122</p>

		<p>question- Is a teleonomic mechanism that helps preserve a larger system to persist and reproduce the same as a mechanism generated by accident? p123</p>
	
		<p>guidance- you should examine evolution closely, to see if its functions are or are not reducible to teleomatic logic 
			and emtentional in appearance only. p123</p>

		<p>A success for Law of Effect: Humoral immune response.</p>

		<p>Common sense suggested immune response was a blank slate - ready to accept what was presented to it. </p>

		<p>Reality: in pre-natal state hypermutation produces vast array of forms.
			Later, when exposed to disease, with a bit of luck some of these forms bind with the enemy.
			If it fits, this is the signal to make more of the same.</p>

		<p>Most will never be used. Fit is only approximate. No information is acquired.</p>

		<p>B F Skinner and behaviorism: spontaneous exploratory behavior analogous to genetic variation.
			Reward or punishment analogous to selection pressures.
			Habit formation or extinction analogous to differential reproduction</p>

		<p>Karl Popper's evolutionary epistemology; progressive adaptation of scientific knowledge to its empirical subject matter.</p>

		<p>Donald T Campbell's blind variation and selective retention.</p>

		<p>Gerald Edelman: start with an overabundance  of neurons and connections. Keep the ones that best reflect converging signal correlations.</p>

		<p>Artifical life: computer simulation of natural selection or unnatural selection. 
			Teleogy free - though parameters are extrinsically determined.

		<p>DNA and RNA mean that life may be understood in the terns of information processing. 'Algorithms' appears to be a reasonable caricature.</p>

		<p>Even evolution may be explained in these terms with the introduction of errors into the code.</p>

		<p>Richard Dawkins's <i>Selfish Gene</i> (1976): possible to think of evolution in informational terms - with genes as the organiational software</p>

		<p>But DNA (software) needs an organism (hardware) to run in.
			For Dawkins; the organism is the medium through which genes influence their probability of being replicated</p>

		<p>Jesper Hoffmeyer: selection external/mutations internal. But mutation is random</p>

		<p>Claus Emmech: organism becomes passive meeting place for forces alien to itself.</p>

		<p>Prions: good example of the complexity of self-replication</>

		<p>Dawkins is not incorrect, but equating information with pattern smuggles in systemic properties</p>

		<p>Paul Weiss (1960s): Biology builds prosthetic devices to make up for amputations to the organic wholeness.</p>

		<p>Organisms are not mere assembles of parts. They grow.</p>

		<p>Élan vital hasn't been snuffed, it's just been pushed into smaller parts within parts - tiny simpler bits have to do the heavy lifting.</p>

		<p>What physical process is the minimum required to get things going? Why ask?

		<p>Materiality is critical.</p>

		<p>Life and evolution show a hint how emergence emerges</p>

		<p>Must start without any <i>telos</i>, but end up with <i>telos - not vice versa</i></p>
