	<h2>Chapter 0 ~ Absence</h2>
		<p><em>In the history of culture, the discovery of zero will always stand out as one of the greatest single achievements of the human race. —Tobias Dantzig, 1930</em> </p>

		<p><i>Chapter summary:
		<ul>
			<li>The objective to solve the mind/mody problem using good science.</li>
			<li>Introduces the notion that what is not there matters.</li>
			<li>Proposes the neologism 'absenntial' to describe this phenomenom.</li>
			<li>Compares the discourse on the absential to the discovery and development of the concept of the number zero.</li>
		</ul>
		</i></p>

		<p>Definition from the <i>Incomplete Nature</i> Glossary:</p>
			<blockquote>
			<b>Absential</b>: The paradoxical intrinsic property of existing with respect to something missing, separate, and possibly nonexistent.
			Although this property is irrelevant when it comes to inanimate things, it is a defining property of life and mind; elsewhere (Deacon 2005) described as a constitutive absence
			</blockquote>

			<p><i>This section:
			<ul>
				<li>Deacon lays down his proposed rules of engagement with traditional philosophy and the scientific method</li>
				<li>Absential is introduced as a neologism, defined and parsed</li>
				<li>Just as the pixels your see in front of you have no meaning in themselves, what is not there matters and may well have phyisical consequence</li>
				<li>A good theory for this must be based on good science</li>

			  [page:Absential Absential],</p>

			<p>Topics covered: </p>

			<hr>

			<p>The current scientific <em>Theory of Everything</em> implies that we do not exist, except as mere collections of atoms. p1</p>

			<p>Parable: Consider the sentences you are now reading.
				The meaning is not in the squiggles, not in the sounds made, not even in the neurons being fired in your brain. p1</p>

			<p>These sentences lacks the properties that normally cause things to happen.
				Information has no mass, momentum, charge, no solidity, no presence of any sense.
				Moreover these sentences could even be nonsense and have no correspondence to reality.
				Nevertheless if that nonsense causes you to wonder, then even unreal nonsense may influence the way you act. p1
				</p>

			<p>Despite the surreal aspects, These sentences were written to convey a meaning.
				And you are expending effort in order to receive this information.</p>

			<p>Thus, there's something not-there there. And what is not there may have physical consequences. p1</p>

			<p>What is absent matters. Longings, desires, passion, appetite, mourning, aspiration
				are all ideas about things not present or that don't exist and have no physical attributes - and yet these are the stuff of life.</p>

			<p>Parable: A shovel is not just a shovel. And it's not a hole in the ground. Yet it is a method of creating holes more easily. p1</p>

			<p>Definition: the [page:Absential Absential] are phenomena whose existence are determined with respect to an essential non-existence. p2</p>

			<p>A complete theory of the world must make sense of what is not there and how what is not there affects what is there. p2</p>
			
			<p>A defining property of life and mind, a causal role for absence seems to be absent from the natural sciences. p2</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Most of science focuses on the things that are actual and present. p3</p>

			<p>Inorganic things tend to fall into disorder. p3 
				When confronted by things that become 'organized' - a non-actual, non-physical trait -
				people have historically tended to ascribe this process to a 'designer'. p3</p>

			<p>In 19th C: Darwin postulated organization without a designer: natural selection.
				People began to observe numerous self-organizing inorganic processes.
				Scholars could begin to that believe the entire gamut of organic and mental process could be described mechanistically in non-absential terms.
				The book is built upon such work. There are, however, caveats... p4</p>

			<p>Example: dynamical systems [an area of mathematics used to describe the behavior of complex dynamical systems, usually by employing differential equations or difference equations.]:
			limited because whatever causes an energetic difference must be seen to exist. p5</p>

			<p>Beginning 1980s, Bateson, von Foerster, Maturana, Varela <i>et al</i> began to see that dynamical systems could not be universal.</p>

			<p>Maturana and Varela (1980): developed concept of <i>autopoesis</i> - self-creating dynamics.
				But this takes too much for granted. Requires an observer. Does not account for the absential. p5</p>

			<p>Thus Descartes's mind-body problem continues. Something is still missing. p6</p>

			<p>Materialism [the only thing that exists is matter or energy] cannot hold true here. p6</p>

			<p>David Chalmers: the emergence of experience goes beyond what can be derived from physics. p6</p>

			<p>Consciousness is what is left after you take away all the physical bits. p7</p>

			<p>Tenet of the book: Consciousness may not be there, but it it is neverthelless materially, causally efficacious. p7</p>

			<p>Not only does consciousness remains [philosohically/scientificaly] unaccounted for. So does 'me'. p8</p>


		<h3>3 Calculating with absence - p8</h3>

			<p><i>This section:
			<ul>
				<li>How the absential might be like zero - ignored, then distrusted, then opening new vistas</li>
			</ul>
			</i></p>

			<p>Key words: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)" target="_blank" title="">zero</a>,
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes" target="" title="">Zeno's paradox</a>
			</p>

			<p>Topics covered: math, philosophy</p>

			<hr>

			<p>This is not the first time this happens. It was the same thing with zero.</p>

			<p>The discovery/invention of zero enabled many other new developments.</p>

			<p>Zero and the absential have many of the same qualities - some good and some maddening.</p>

			<p>Dealing with the absential - as with dividing by zero - has caused fear among scientists, but could lead to many new discoveries.</p>

			</p>

			<p>Topics covered: philosophy</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Ignoring the absential causes the invention of tricks, hacks and workarounds.</p>

			<p>In science, the essential features of life are considered illusory - this opens the door for religious thinking.</p>

			<p>Inability to integrate the absential handicaps us - as the absence of zero did in the past.</p>

			<p>Hello! We do need a scientific proof/explanation of our own reality.</p>

			<p>Let us envisage the physical and the meaningful coming together.</p>

			<hr>

			<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> is an attempt towards unifying [mind and body].</p>

			<p>This work: Will be scorned, ridiculed. Will take effort and time. Will be a risk. But avoidance causes cynical, negative thinking.</p>
			<p>Will be difficult, not obvious as answers are not where they were meant to be.
			Yet: 'Can do!'</p>

			<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>o be "As simple as possible, but not too simple"</li>
				<li>Designed for curious, well-educated reader</li>
				<li>Require minimum prior knowledge and technical paraphernalia [equations and formulas]</li>
				<li>Neologisms will be coined
			</ul>

			<p>The book is divided into three sections:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Chapters 1-5: Show that science has not dealt with the absential.</li>
				<li>Chapters 3-10: Outlines an alternative approach - that allows for the absential</li>
				<li>Chapters 11-17: Explores the implications of a science that encompasses the absential</li>
			</ol>

			<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> is a first baby step. Kindly play along and you will glimpse the future of science.</p>
