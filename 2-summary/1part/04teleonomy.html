2013-04-10 ~ I need to decide if this chapter is primarily about the natural selection of functions.

And, if so, adjust the wording accordingly and learn more about the biological differences between forms and functions.

	<h2>Chapter 4 ~ TELEONOMY</h2>

		<p><i>Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.</i> 
			&mdash; J B S Haldane

		<p><i>This chapter:
		<ul>
		<li>Living things seem to violate the laws of nature: entropy rules</li>
			<li>But the second law of thermodynamics is not really a law. It's a very, very strong tendency.</li>
			<li>Law of effect replaces teleology. The mechanisms for producing both forms and functions are separate from the processes of preserving them</li>			
			<li> Colin Pittendrigh/1958: Teleonomy: law-like behavior, asymmetric, predictive</li>

			<li>Neither fractionation nor computation offer answers without homunculi.</li>
			<li>What did we do to go from nothing to something?</li>
			<li>Natural selection could not have produced the conditions that made natural selection possible.</li>

			<blockquote>
                Teleology is any philosophical account that holds that final causes exist in nature, meaning that design and purpose analogous 
				to that found in human actions are inherent also in the rest of nature.

            </blockquote>
    		
    		<blockquote><b>Teleonomy (Teleonomic)</b>: Teleological in name only. A terminological distinction that would exemplify a middle ground between mere mechanism and purpose,

		<p>recap- Rudolf Clausius/1865: Entropy - the tendency in nature for things to fall apart. p107</p>
		
		<p>description- Second law of thermodynamics: all other things being equal: entropy will go for broke. p107</p>
		
		<p>description- Thus: Life and thinking - order and organization - are quite unnatural and appear to violate a universal law. p108</p>
		
		<p>observation- Loophole: Second law is a tendency - but not a necessity. There's room to wiggle here. p108</p>
		
		<p>observation- In life: Time reversal appears implicit as is Aristotle's 'final cause'. p109</p>
		
		<p>observation- an organism implies ongoing increasing of complexity that counters the incessant messiness of entropy.

		<hr>

		<p>description- The production of orderliness - localized opposition to the second law of thermodynamics 
			- is what distinguishes life from inorganic processes. p109</p>
		
		<p>description- The processes produced by organisms are not mere tendencies, but can be termed as <i>functions</i>. p110</p>
		
		<p>description- We know of functions as part of the process of design. Darwin taught us that functions may emerge spontaneously. p110</p>

		<p>recap-  The logic of natural selection defeats claims that teleogy is necessary to explain complexity of biology. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Daniel Dennet: natural selection is the universal acid. p110</p>
		
		<p>observation- Theory of natural selection = statistics. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin: How do organisms become suited to their environment:
			<ol>
				<li>reproduce,</li>
				<li>diverge</li>
				<li>produce surfeit</li>
			</ol>
		p110</p>
		
		<p>recap- Darwin: Process generates inequalities. Differs with Lamarck's inheritance of acquired characteristics. p110</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin's discovery/<i>Descent of Man</i>: logic of natural selection is the <i>after-the-fact</i> logic p111. 
			Favorable outcomes preferentially reproduced, retained or expressed.
			How these are generated matters not. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Edward Thorndike's 'Law of Effect': organisms adapt their behavior to their environment. p111</p>

		<p>observation- Why did it take so long to discover? Humans are designers. 
			Maybe because it is easier to think there's a supreme designer than to intuit the spontaneity. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Empedocles: orderliness may arrive spontaneously - by preserved accident. 
			Only combinations that produce balance/fitness likely to persist and produce progeny. p111</p>

		<p>recap- Aristotle disses Empedocles. How could the order and beauty we see be merely accidental? There's an <i>entelechy</i> lurking. p113</p>

		<p>recap- Darwin's thoughts: provoked by Malthus, supervene Larmarck. p113</p>
		
		<p>recap- Darwin: Mechanisms for reproducing and preserving forms and functions are entirely separable. p113</p>

		<p>recap- Jacques Monod's <i>Chance and Necessity</i>: all of natural science [systems of molecular biology] 
			may be explained without final causality or teleological processes. p114</p>

		<hr>
		
		<p>comparison- Machines require assembly. Organisms develop spontaneously. Though they appear similar, they are opposites. p114</p>
<!--
Insert pretty table here comparing organisms and machines
-->
		<p>recap- Ernst Mayer/1974: we can avoid confusing the asymmetric activities - by distinguishing the variations. 
			Nonetheless all can be understood as thoroughly mechanistic - an exception: life itself. p115</p>

		<p>recap- Van Quine: Darwin shows that nature needs no Aristotelian final cause - she can be explained merely by physics and chemistry. p115</p>

		<p>recap- Colin Pittendrigh/1958: coins <i>teleonomy</i>: law-like behavior, asymmetric, predictive. p115</p>

		<p>observation- A mechanical process can be organized so it converges towards a specific state.</p>
	
        <p>caveat- This is NOT behavior for the the sake of the end state.</p>

		<p>assertion: Teleonomy: target-directed, but behavior agnostic, consequence-blind, accident-driven</p>

		<p>observation: Teleonomy: itself an accident, a mechanism.</p>

		<p>example- The thermostat (in a Bateson-like manner): it behaves precisely how a purpose-driven human would behave. p116</p>

		<p>example- Old Faithful: shows a teleonomic mechanism can arise by accident. p117</p>

		<p>consequence- It/we/them may all be an accident. p117</p>

		<p>example- Consider human body temperature regulation: similar to thermostat, maintains a temperature. p118</p>

		<p>description- Body temperature is not just any arbitrary temperature, 
			it is the most suitable temperature for a variety of metabolic processes to operate optimally. p118</p>
		
        <p>observation- Body temperature: target is extrinsic. Not accidental like old Faithful. p118</p>
			
		<p>outcome- But ultimately body temperature is just most successful surviving variant. p118</p>	

		<p>recap- Mayr: 'A teleonomic process or behavior is one which owes its goal-directedness to the operation of the program.' p119</p>
		
		<p>observation- Use of term 'program' is important. Because denotes algorithms of any level of complexity. p119</p>

		<p>caveat- But do not confuse an extrinsic abstract description with something that is intrinsic. p120</p>

		<p>recap- Mayr: Teleomatic: asymmetric, end-directed, in a passive automatic way, regulated by external forces or conditions. p120</p>

		<p>observation- Teleology, teleonomic, teleomatic: terms now widely accepted. p121</p>
<!--
Is this the main point of the chapter?

-->
		<p>question- But what are the differences between: human design, natural selection and happy accident? p122</p>
        
		<p>define- <i>telos</i> An ultimate object or aim. p122</p>
        
        <p>observation- Anything made by humans: we accept its <i>telos</i> is extrinsic. p122</p>
		
        <p>observation- Anything in nature we (including ourselves) accept its <i>telos</i> is accidental 
            - even if the terms we use seem to imply <i>telos</i>. p122</p>

		<p>question- But what about the many adaptive features, embedded in an organism, 
            that exist because of their contribution to something else? p122</p>

		<p>question- Is a teleonomic mechanism that helps preserve a larger system to persist and reproduce 
            the same as a mechanism generated by accident? p123</p>
            
        <p>Are body parts teleological, teleonomic or teleomatic?</p>     
	
		<p>guidance- you should examine evolution closely, to see if its functions are or are not reducible to teleomatic logic 
			and [[page:Ententional ententional]] in appearance only. p123</p>

		<p>recap- A success for Law of Effect: Humoral immune response. p124</p>
        
		<p>recap- Common sense suggested immune response was a blank slate - ready to accept what was presented to it. p124</p>

		<p>recap- Reality: in pre-natal state hypermutation produces vast array of forms.
			Later, when exposed to disease, with a bit of luck some of these forms bind with the enemy.
			If it fits, this is the signal to make more of the same. p124</p>

		<p>question- What physical process is the minimum required to get things going? Why ask? p136</p>
<!-- a biggie -->		
		<p>assertion- Natural selection could not have produced the conditions that made natural selection possible. p136</p>
 
		<p>observation- The details matter. Materiality - the consideration of the substrate - unlike computers - is critical - dictates persistence. p136</p>

		<p>observation- Darwin ignores the 'how' in natural selection. Yet the 'how' encompasses adaptation, function, information. p137  </p>
		
		<p>description- Life and evolution show a hint how emergence emerges. p137</p>
<!-- or this one?  -->
		<p>observation- Must start without any <i>telos</i>, but end up with <i>telos</i> - not vice versa. p138</p>

		<p>question- How can ententional properties come into existence where none existed before - and have good science?</p>
		
		<p>caveat- there is no point at which ententional properties slip into the second law of thermodynamics. p138 </p>

		<p>caveat- Fractionation not good/no help. Just because you make things smaller, this doesn't mean they are time reversible. p139</p>
		
		<p>observation- at some point <i>telos</i> does emerge from simpler mechanics. How this happens is what must be explained. p140</p>
		
		<p>observation- Homunculi point to the unfinished business. p140</p>

		<p>definition- 1. Life had its origins in non-living matter. Progresses. Minds are an evolved property of complex animals. p140</p>
		
		<p>definition- 2. Humans thoughts emerge from the cacophony of neurons. Mind emerges from simpler processes - originally and continually. 141</p>
		
		<p>question- How do you get something from nothing. Complex out of simple? Cloth out of threads... p141</p>
		
		<p>description- We can see how organisms do this. But how does the inanimate and inorganic do this?
			How do we get from the basic physics to the the beginning of life? p141</p>
			
		<p>observation- It's all a continuum - of reciprocal limitations. p141</p>

		<p>question- How can a higher dimension arise from a lower dimension? p142</p>
