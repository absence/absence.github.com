     <h2>Ententional</h2> 
     <h3>From the Glossary</h3> 
    <p>Ententional: A generic adjective coined in this book for describing all phenomena
      that are intrinsically incomplete in the sense of being in relationship to, constituted
      by, or organized to achieve something non-intrinsic. This includes function, information,
      meaning, reference, representation, agency, purpose, sentience, and value</p>
    <hr
    />
    <p>Constitutive absence: A particular and precise missing something that is a critical
      defining attribute of 'ententional' phenomena, such as functions, thoughts, adaptations,
      purposes, and subjective experiences.</p>
    <p>Emergent dynamics: A theory developed in this book which explains how homeodynamic
      (e.g., thermodynamic) processes can give rise to morphodynamic (e.g., self-organizing)
      processes, which can give rise to teleodynamic (e.g., living and mental) processes.
      Intended to legitimize scientific uses of ententional (intentional, purposeful,
      normative) concepts by demonstrating the way that processes at a higher level in
      this hierarchy emerge from, and are grounded in, simpler physical processes, but
      exhibit reversals of the otherwise ubiquitous tendencies of these lower-level processes</p>
    <p>Intentional: In common usage, an adjective describing an act that is performed
      on purpose. Technically, in twentieth-century philosophy of mind, it is a term
      deriving from the medieval Scholastics, reintroduced by the German philosopher
      Brentano, to designate a characteristic common to all sensations, ideas, thoughts,
      and desires: the fact that they are 'about' something other than themselves</p>
    <p>Preformationism: Narrowly, the assumption that the human physique was preformed
      from conception. More broadly as used here, the assumption that ententional phenomena
      were performed in antecedent phenomena - that, for example, language is preformed
      in a universal grammar module, information is preformed in DNA, or that consciousness
      is preformed in the mind of God</p>
     <h3>Ententional</h3> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>existing with-respect-to, for-the-sake-of, or in-order-to-generate something that
        is absent - p26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>includes a function at one extreme and value at the other - p26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>generic term/adjective - p26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>phenomena that are intrinsically incomplete in the sense of being in relationship
        to, constituted by, or organized to achieve something non-intrinsic - p26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>a fundemental relationship to something absent - p26
        <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ententional phenomena include functions that have</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>satisfaction conditions,
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>adaptations that have environmental correlates,
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>thoughts that have contents,
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>purposes that have goals,
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>subjective experiences that have a self/other perspective
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>values that have a self that benefits or is harmed. -p27
        <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although functions, adaptations, thoughts, purposes, subjective experiences, and
      values each have distinct attributes that distinguish them, they all also have
      an orientation to a specific constitutive absence, a particular and precise missing
      something that is their critical defining attribute - p27</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt; extrinsic?</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt; If intentional is the ground, ententional is the background?</p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Absential</h3> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, we lack a single term in the English language (or others that I know
        of) that captures this more generic sense of existing with-respect-to, for-the-sake-of,
        or in-order-to-generate something that is absent that also includes function at
        one extreme and value at the other. The recognition that there is a common core
        property characterizing how each of these involves a necessary linkage with, and
        inclination toward, something absent argues for finding a term to refer to it -
        p26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Ententional phenomena include functions that have satisfaction conditions, adaptations
        that have environmental correlates, thoughts that have contents, purposes that
        have goals, subjective experiences that have a self/other perspective, and values
        that have a self that benefits or is harmed. Although functions, adaptations, thoughts,
        purposes, subjective experiences, and values each have distinct attributes that
        distinguish them, they all also have an orientation to a specific constitutive
        absence, a particular and precise missing something that is their critical defining
        attribute - p 26
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Ententional processes and relationships can best be classed as expressions of
        final causality in Aristotle's terms. Their absential character is determined by
        the end toward which they tend, or the represented concept for the sake of which
        they were created. But with this erosion of the plurality of causal concepts, a
        place for a form of causal influence derived from something absent was no longer
        acceptable - p35-42 &lt;&lt; much discussion on the absential follows.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>When a system exhibits ententional properties, it is because something physical
        is missing, not added - p42
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>By examining this model system more closely, we will be able to demonstrate how
        ententional processes acquire this seemingly paradoxical character of efficacious
        absence - p311
        <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Causality</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>If ententionally phenomena are causally import then types of things can have real
          physical consequences - p29
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Ententional processes and relationships can best be classed as expressions of
          final causality in Aristotle's terms - p35
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>Their absential character is determined by the end toward which they tend, or
          the represented concept for the sake of which they were created - p35
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Conscious</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conscious experience - most commonplace phenomenon of everyday life - is quintessence
          of an ententional phenomenon - p33-34
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Emergence</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>ententional and emergence subtly tangled - p32
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ figure / background</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inversion of perspective to pay attention to what is missing resolves dilemma
          of ententional. A counterintuitive figure/background reversal, focusing on what
          is absent rather than present, offers a means to repair some of the serious inadequacies
          in our conceptions of matter, order, life, work, information, representation, and
          even consciousness and conceptions of value - p44
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Functionalism / Multiple Realizability</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>All ententional phenomena have multiple realizability - p30
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Reduction</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>ententional phenomena often particular in embidiment - causal consequences irreeducibly
          depend on some general type - p42
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <h3>Ententional ~ Science</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>from physical-chemistry point of view, ententional appears like magic - p3
          <br
          />
        </li>
        <li>science ignores or bans ententional - p31
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>to science, ententional phenomena appear invisible - p32
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>ententional phenomena are a basic universal property like mas or charge. Everything
          is ententional in some respect - p39
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>wherever we place the fence between ententional and physical, we need instructions
          as how to pass through the fence - p40
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
	<hr>
	<p>some of the below may also be above...</p>
	<p>Entention to characterize an internal relationship to a telosean end, or otherwise
      displaced - p27</p> 
    <p>Ententional phenomena</p> 
    <p> </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>asymmetrical<br /></li> 
      <li>hierarchical</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Scholars and scientists differ on meaning of intention and purpose. - p27</p> 
    <p>Ententional phenomena</p> 
    <p> </p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>multiple realizability<br /></li> 
      <li>can be embodied in highly diverse physical-chemical processes and substrates<br /></li> 
      <li>have real physical consequences<br /></li> 
      <li>thus realist as opposed to nominalist - p29<br /></li> 
      <li>see also functionalism, but:<br /></li> 
      <li>interchangeability of consequences even more important<br /></li> 
      <li>potential consequences also generals - as well as virtual and absent</li>
    </ul>
