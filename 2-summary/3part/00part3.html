	<h2>Part 3 Summary ~ Chapters 11-17 ~ Exploring the Implications</h2> 

		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 3 as follows:</p>

		<p>"Having laid the groundwork for an expanded science capable of encompassing these basic absential relations, 
			I explore a few of the implications for reformulating theories of work, information, evolution, self, sentience, and value. 
			This is a vast territory, and in these final chapters I only intend to hint at the ways that this figure/background shift 
			in perspective necessarily reformulates how these fundamental concepts need to be reconsidered."
