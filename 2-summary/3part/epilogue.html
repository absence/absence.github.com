     <h2>Epilogue</h2> 
    <h3>Nothing matters - p 539</h3>
    <p>Nothing lost on the way. Laws of physics are still intact. I'm more like the hole
      in the hub than the rim on the wheel.</p>
    <p>We are constrained - by properties or degrees of freedom not actualized</p>
    <p>Two levels of processes can become so entangled that...</p>
    <p>It's time to recognize that there is room for meaning, purpose, and value in the
      fabric of physical explanations, because these phenomena effectively occupy the
      absences that differentiate and interrelate the world that is physically present.
      p 541</p>
    <h3>The calculus of intentionality - p 541</h3>
    <p>autogenic processes - a thought experiment - the premature halting of morphodynamic
      processes - the failure to continue - creates an entropy ratchet</p>
    <p>teleodynamics enables potentially indefinite to enable something intrinsically
      incomplete to bring itself into existence</p>
    <p>-- Millikan's lion vs Shroedinger's cat?</p>
    <p>- The zero, differentiation and integration of absentialism has been described</p>
    <p>p 542</p>
    <p>Function is a geometric or formal relationship, not a material efficient one.</p>
    <p>specifying a function is like a differentiation in calculus - specifying an intrinsic
      (instantaneous) telos.</p>
    <p>value of physical attributes to overall teleodynamics can be estimated - is the
      analogue of integration in calculus.</p>
    <p>with emergence of teleodynamics, nature begins to discover zero.</p>
    <p>This needed existence of complex molecules capable of forming into autogenic configurations.</p>
    <p>life and mind are the embodied calculus of physical processes leaping up from
      one teleodynamic level to the next</p>
    <h3>Value - p 543</h3>
    <p>Natural sciences appears to have no place for right/wrong, meaningful/meaningless,
      beauty/ugliness, good/evil, love/hate, and so forth. p 543</p>
    <p>for many nihilism more threatening than death &lt;&lt; thus the need religion?</p>
    <p>The universe is is much larger than what we can see and touch and manipulate with
      out hands or our cyclotrons.</p>
    <p>There is more here than stuff. There is how stuff is organized and related to
      other stuff. And then there is more than what is actual. p 544</p>
    <p>There is what could be, what should be, what could be, what can't be, what is
      possible and what is impossible.</p>
