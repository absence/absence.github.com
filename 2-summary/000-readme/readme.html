    <h3>Book Parts</h3> 
    <p>Deacon says the book is divided into three parts.</p> 
    <h3>Part 1 ~ Chapters 1-5 ~ Outlining the Problem</h3> 
    <p>&quot;I show that the conceptual riddles posed by absential phenomena have not been
      dealt with, despite claims that they have been overcome, but rather that they have
      been swept under the rug in various ingenious ways. By critiquing the history of
      efforts to explain them or explain them away, I argue that our various efforts
      have only served to insinuate these difficulties more cryptically into our current
      scientific and humanistic paradigms.&quot;</p> 
    <h3>Part 2 ~ Chapters 6-10 ~ Outlining an Alternative Theory</h3> 
    <p>&quot;I outline an alternative approachâ€”a theory of emergent dynamics that shows how
      dynamical process can become organized around and with respect to possibilities
      not realized. This is intended to provide the scaffolding for a conceptual bridge
      from mechanistic relationships to end-directed, informational, and normative relationships
      such as are found in simple life forms.&quot;</p> 
    <h3>Part 3 ~ Chapters 11-17 ~ Exploring the Implications</h3> 
    <p>&quot;Having laid the groundwork for an expanded science capable of encompassing these
      basic absential relations, I explore a few of the implications for reformulating
      theories of work, information, evolution, self, sentience, and value. This is a
      vast territory, and in these final chapters I only intend to hint at the ways that
      this figure/background shift in perspective necessarily reformulates how these
      fundamental concepts need to be reconsidered.&quot;</p>
