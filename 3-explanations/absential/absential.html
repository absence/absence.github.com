    <h2>absential</h2> 
    <h3>From the Glossary</h3> 
    <p><strong>Absential</strong>: The paradoxical intrinsic property of existing with
      respect to something missing, separate, and possibly nonexistent. Although this
      property is irrelevant when it comes to inanimate things, it is a defining property
      of life and mind; elsewhere (Deacon 2005) described as a constitutive absence</p> 
    <p><strong>Constitutive absence</strong>: A particular and precise missing something
      that is a critical defining attribute of 'ententional' phenomena, such as functions,
      thoughts, adaptations, purposes, and subjective experiences.</p> 
    <h3>Absential - p3</h3>

      <li>irrelevant when it comes to inanimate things, but a defining property of life
      and mind<br /></li>

      <li>not just superimposed probable physical relationships</li> 
      <li>each an intrinsically
      absent aspect of something present<br /></li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <h3>Absential - p544</h3> 
    <p> </p>
    <ul> 
      <li>The universe is larger than just that which we can see, and touch, or manipulate
      with our hands or our cyclotrons.<br /></li> 
      <li>There is more here than stuff.<br /></li> 
      <li>There is how this stuff is organized and related to other stuff.<br /></li> 
      <li>And there is more than what is actual.<br /></li> 
      <li>&nbsp;There is what could be, what should be, what can't be, what is possible, and
      what is impossible.<br /></li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <h3>Absential ~ Causality</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>a form of causality dependent on specifically absent features and unrealized
      potentials can be compatible with our best science - p16<br /></li>
        <li>How can something not there be the cause of anything? Making sense of this - efficacy
      of absence - will be the central challenge of this book - p45<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>  
    <h3>Absential ~ Consciousness / self</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Like meanings and purposes, consciousness may not be something there in any
      typical sense of being materially or energetically embodied, and yet may still
      be materially causally relevant - p7<br /></li>
        <li>an additional issue with consciousness that makes it particularly insistent,
      in a way that these other absential relations aren't: that which is explicitly
      absent is me - p8<br /></li>
        <li>this approach can help to illuminate to what extent the phenomenon of self is
      not a simple physical property of bodies or brains, but rather a critical absential
      character, which is ultimately the locus of the reflexive individuation that creates
      the distinction from non-self - p467<br /></li>
        <li>The intentional properties that we attribute to conscious experience are generated
      by the emergence of these constraints-constraints that emerge from constraints,
      absences that arise from, and create, new absences. You are in this quite literal
      sense something coming out of nothing, and thus newly embodied at each instant
      p535<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>    
    <h3>Absential ~ Constraints</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>This concept of constraint can provide a negative approach to realism, though
      it might also be paradoxically described as a nominalism of absences, since it
      is determined by discrete interaction effects that don't occur - p191<br /></li>
        <li>In each case, there are reduced degrees of freedom that could potentially be
      realized in the absence of these constraints - p192<br /></li>
        <li>This requires that we show how what is absent is responsible for the causal
      power of organization and the asymmetric dynamics of a physical or living process.
      Beginning to explain how this might be possible is the major task of this chapter
      - p195<br /></li>
        <li>Constraints are the present signature of what is absent - p484<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>    
    <h3>Absential ~ Ententional</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently, we lack a single term in the English language (or others that I know
      of) that captures this more generic sense of existing with-respect-to, for-the-sake-of,
      or in-order-to-generate something that is absent that also includes function at
      one extreme and value at the other. The recognition that there is a common core
      property characterizing how each of these involves a necessary linkage with, and
      inclination toward, something absent argues for finding a term to refer to it -
      p26<br /></li>
        <li>Ententional phenomena include functions that have satisfaction conditions, adaptations
      that have environmental correlates, thoughts that have contents, purposes that
      have goals, subjective experiences that have a self/other perspective, and values
      that have a self that benefits or is harmed. Although functions, adaptations, thoughts,
      purposes, subjective experiences, and values each have distinct attributes that
      distinguish them, they all also have an orientation to a specific constitutive
      absence, a particular and precise missing something that is their critical defining
      attribute - p 26<br /></li>
        <li>Ententional processes and relationships can best be classed as expressions of
      final causality in Aristotle's terms. Their absential character is determined by
      the end toward which they tend, or the represented concept for the sake of which
      they were created. But with this erosion of the plurality of causal concepts, a
      place for a form of causal influence derived from something absent was no longer
      acceptable - p35-42 &lt;&lt; much discussion on the absential follows.<br /></li>
        <li>By examining this model system more closely, we will be able to demonstrate
      how ententional processes acquire this seemingly paradoxical character of efficacious
      absence - p311<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>    
    <h3>Absential ~ Evolution</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because organisms are constituted by specially organized, persistent, far-from-equilibrium
      processes, they are intrinsically incomplete. In this regard, they are processes
      organized around absence - p416<br /></li>
        <li>The ability to produce highly diverse and yet precise constraints-absences-thus
      makes possible a nearly unlimited capacity for selves to intervene in the goings-on
      of the natural world - p480<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>  
    <h3>Absential ~ figure / background</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>A counterintuitive figure/background reversal, focusing on what is absent rather
      than present, offers a means to repair some of the serious inadequacies in our
      conceptions of matter, order, life, work, information, representation, and even
      consciousness and conceptions of value - p44<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p> 
    <h3>Absential ~ Information</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information is the archetypical absential concept - p373<br /></li>
        <li>The importance of physical regularity to the analysis of information is that
      it is ultimately what enables absence to matter - p376<br /></li>
        <li>As we have repeatedly argued, regularity is the expression of constraint, and
      it is with respect to some constraint on variety that something absent or deviant
      can stand out. This absence or deviance is ultimately what is conveyed - p377<br /></li>
        <li>Shannon's analysis of information capacity provides another example of the critical
      role of absence - p379<br /></li>
        <li>Because of this explicit physical constraint, even the absence of any change
      of signal entropy can provide referential information p 387 &lt;&lt; Much discussion
      on the absential follows<br /></li>
        <li>The informative power of absence is one of the clearest indications that Shannon
      information and referential information are not equivalent - p 387<br /></li>
        <li>This combination of absence and necessary relevance to an asymmetric process,
      incessantly interacting with and modifying the world, is what projects the property
      of information into otherwise merely physical states and events - p417<br /></li>
        <li>These absences embody, in the negative, the constraints imposed on the physical
      substrates of signals, thoughts, and communications which can be transferred from
      one substrate to another, and which thereby play efficacious roles in the world
      as inherited constraints on what tends to occur, rather than acting as pushes or
      pulls forcing events in one direction or another - p419<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>        
    <h3>Absential ~ Non-absential</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many scholars now believe that developing a science capable of accurately characterizing
      complex self-organizing phenomena will be sufficient to finally describe organic
      and mental relationships in entirely non-absential terms - p5<br /></li>
        <li>absential features must, by definition, be treated as epiphenomenal glosses
      that need to be reduced to specific physical substrates or else excluded from the
      analysis - p5.<br /></li>
        <li>Simply asserting this necessary unity-that an observing subject must be a physical
      system with a self-referential character-avoids the implicit absurdity of denying
      absential phenomena, and yet it defines them out of existence. We seem to still
      be living in the shadow of Descartes - p6<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>   
    <h3>Absential ~ Purpose</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The most characteristic and developed exemplar of an absential relationship
      is purpose - p24<br /></li>
        <li>purpose is more complex than other absential relationships because other forms
      of absential relationship are implicit in the concept of purpose - p24<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p>  
    <h3>Absential ~ Reduction</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Absence has no components, and so it can't be reduced or eliminated - p204<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p> 
    <h3>Absential ~ Teleodynamics</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>So, in effect, each is the expression of a form of higher-order absence generated
      by relationships between lower-order absences. This doubly negative, doubly absential
      character of teleodynamic processes is almost certainly one reason that we find
      them so mechanistically counterintuitive - p323<br /></li>
      </ul>
    </p> 
    <h3>Absential ~ Value</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's time to recognize that there is room for meaning, purpose, and value in
      the fabric of physical explanations, because these phenomena effectively occupy
      the absences that differentiate and interrelate the world that is physically present
      - p541<br /></li>
        <li>If quantum physicists can learn to become comfortable with the material causal
      consequences of the superposition of alternate, as-yet-unrealized states of matter,
      it shouldn't be too great a leap to begin to get comfortable with the superposition
      of the present and the absent in our functions, meanings, experiences, and values
      - p 544<br /></li>
      </ul>

    <p>I will refer to this as an absential feature, to denote phenomena whose existence
      is determined with respect to an essential absence. This could be a state of things
      not yet realized, a specific separate object of a representation, a general type
      of property that may or may not exist, an abstract quality, an experience, and
      so forth-just not that which is actually present. This paradoxical intrinsic quality
      of existing with respect to something missing, separate, and possibly nonexistent
      is irrelevant when it comes to inanimate things, but it is a defining property
      of life and mind.</p>

    <p>In an important sense, purpose is more complex than other absential relationships
      because we find all other forms of absential relationship implicit in the concept
      of purpose. It is most commonly associated with a psychological state of acting
      or intending to act so as to potentially bring about the realization of a mentally
      represented goal. This not only involves an orientation toward a currently non-existing
      state of affairs, it assumes an explicit representation of that end, with respect
      to which actions may be organized. Also, the various actions and processes typically
      employed to achieve that goal function for the sake of it. Finally, the success
      or failure to achieve that goal has value because it is in some way relevant to
      the agency for the sake of which it is pursued. And all these features are contributors
      to the sentience of simple organisms and the conscious experience of thinking beings
      like ourselves.</p>

    <p>Thus autonomy and agency, and their implicit teleology, and even the locus of
      subjectivity, can be given a concrete account. Paradoxically, however, by filling
      in the physical dynamics of this account, we end up with a non-material conception
      of organism and neurological self, and by extension, of subjective self as well:
      a self that is embodied by dynamical constraints. But constraints are the present
      signature of what is absent. So, surprisingly, this view of self shows it to be
      as non-material as Descartes might have imagined, and yet as physical, extended,
      and relevant to the causal scheme of things as is the hole at the hub of a wheel.</p>

    <p>The universe is larger than just that which we can see, and touch, or manipulate

      There is what could be, what should be, what can't be, what is possible, and what
      is impossible.</p>
