    <p>The emergence of the form of self that characterizes human subjectivity is in
      contrast a very recent, very special, and very much higher-order variant of this
      first transition. p467</p>

    <p>Boundaries</p> 
    <p>protective encasement is a nearly ubiquitous feature of organism design - whether
      for viruses, bacteria, amoebas, plants, or animals - because reciprocity is always
      potentially disruptable by the intrusion of extrinsic influences. p471</p>

    <p>although our attention tends to be drawn to these boundary interfaces when focusing
      on what constitutes self, this interface is better understood as an adaptation
      to better preserve the self already there. p 471</p>

    <p>The metabolic self (so to speak) of these cells is bounded in the cell membrane,
      but that feature of biological self which maintains this ultimate hedge against
      the ravages of entropy - duplication - has been shifted to the whole organism.</p>

    <p>life/organisms/selves/individuation</p> 
    <p>vegetative / neuronal / mental self</p> 
    <p>defined by constraints</p> 
    <p>Self is, in all cases, the origin, target, and beneficiary of functional organization,
      whether molecular or mental. p466</p> 
    <p>Multiple selves</p> 
    <p>metabolic self p 471</p>

    <p>mental selves</p> 
    <p>brain selves?</p> 
    <p>Does every self have its characteristic sentience?</p> 
    <p>Central thesis the core property which links the selves of even the simplest life
      forms with that seemingly ineffable property that characterizes the human experience
      of self is a special form of dynamical organization: teleodynamics.</p> 
    <p>What has not been made explicit, however, is that all teleodynamic processes are
      implicitly individuated, that is, they are closed in a fundamental sense with respect
      to other dynamical features of the world.</p> 
    <p>This special form of closure is reflected in the phrase 'reflective individuation'
      used earlier, which I introduce to explicitly avoid using the prefix 'self-' (as
      in self-maintaining, self-organizing, self-reproducing) in defining the fundamental
      organizational logic of self.</p>
