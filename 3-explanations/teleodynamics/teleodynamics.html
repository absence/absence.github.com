<h2>Teleodynamics</h2>
<p>Teleodynamics - glossary
<p>A form of dynamical organization exhibiting end-directedness and consequence-organized features that is constituted by the co-creation, complementary constraint, and reciprocal synergy of two or more strongly coupled morphodynamic processes

<p>	* Figure 9.1: Orthograde = recursive self-reconstruction and reproduction of systems of constraints 
<p>	* a dynamical form of organization that promotes its own persistence and maintenance by modifying this dynamics to more effectively utilize supportive extrinsic conditions. 
<p>	* not identifiable with any particular constituents, or even any constituent morphodynamic process. 
<p>	* organized with respect to its own persistence
<p>	* not bound to specific material substrates or component dynamical process
