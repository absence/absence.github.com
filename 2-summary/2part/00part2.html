	<h2>Part 2 Summary ~ Chapters 6-10 ~ Outlining an Alternative Theory</h2> 
	
		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 2 as follows:</p>
		
		<p>"I outline an alternative approachâ€”a theory of emergent dynamics that shows how dynamical process can become organized 
			around and with respect to possibilities not realized. 
			This is intended to provide the scaffolding for a conceptual bridge from mechanistic relationships 
			to end-directed, informational, and normative relationships such as are found in simple life forms."
