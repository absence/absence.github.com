	<h2>Part 1 Summary ~ Chapters 1-5 ~ Outlining the Problem</h2> 
	
		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 1 as follows:</p>
		
		<blockquote>I show that the conceptual riddles posed by absential phenomena have not been dealt with, despite claims that they have been overcome, 
			but rather that they have been swept under the rug in various ingenious ways. 
			By critiquing the history of efforts to explain them or explain them away, 
			I argue that our various efforts have only served to insinuate these difficulties more cryptically 
			into our current scientific and humanistic paradigms.
