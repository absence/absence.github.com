    <h2>Autogen</h2> 
    <p><b>Autocell</b>: A minimal molecular teleodynamic system (termed an
      autogen in this book), consisting of mutually reinforcing autocatalytic process
      and a molecular self-assembly process, first described in Deacon 2006a</p> 
    <p><b>Autogen</b>: A self-generating system at the phase transition between
      morphodynamics and teleodynamics; any form of self-generating, self-repairing,
      self-replicating system that is constituted by reciprocal morphodynamic processes</p> 
    <p><b>Autogenic</b>: Adjective describing any process involving reciprocally
      reinforcing morphodynamic processes that thereby has the potential to self-reconstitute
      and/or reproduce</p> 
    <p><b>Autogeneses:</b> The combination of self-generation, self-repair, self-replication
      capacities that is made possible by teleodynamic organization; the process by which
      reciprocally reinforcing morphodynamic processes become a self-generating autogen</p>
