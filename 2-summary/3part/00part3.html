	<h2>Part 3 Summary ~ Chapters 11-17 ~ Exploring the Implications</h2> 

		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 3 as follows:</p>

		<blockquote>"Having laid the groundwork for an expanded science capable of encompassing these basic absential relations, 
			I explore a few of the implications for reformulating theories of work, information, evolution, self, sentience, and value. 
			This is a vast territory, and in these final chapters I only intend to hint at the ways that this figure/background shift 
			in perspective necessarily reformulates how these fundamental concepts need to be reconsidered."
		</blockquote>	

		<h3>Current Status</h3>
	
		<p><i>2013-05-18 ~ The effort to summarize chapters 11-17 and the epilogue is still at a fairly early stage. 
			A first pass has been made on most chapters that collects the key words and summarizes text section by section.
			Several more passes need to be made in order to bring the effort up to the level of part 1.
