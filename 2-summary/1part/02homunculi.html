	<h2>Chapter 2 ~ Homunculi</h2> 
		<p><i>...wherever a theory relies on a formulation bearing the logical marks of intentionality, there a little man is concealed.</i> 
			&mdash; Daniel Dennet, 1978</p>
			
		<hr>	
		
		<p><i>This chapter:
		<ul>
			<li>Investigates the appearance of the homunculus thoughout history, both admitted and inadmitted, both in the humanities and the sciences.</li>
			<li>Homunculus is a postponement of the explanation. Exposing the homunculus: nothing gets explained but the trick itself</li>
			<li>For Deacon, the homunculus is the <i>cogito</i> in <i>cogito, ergo sum</i></li>
			<li>Examines a number of historical concepts that describe how we cam to be</li>
		</ul>
		</i></p>
		
		<p>From the <i>Incomplete Nature</i> glossary:</p>
			<blockquote>Homunculus: Any tiny or cryptic humanlike form or creature, something slightly less than human, though exhibiting certain human attributes. In recent scientific literature, “homunculus” has also come to mean the misuse of teleological assumptions: the unacknowledged gap-fillers that stand behind, outside, or within processes involving apparent teleological processes, such as many features of life and mind, and pretend to be explanations of their function </blockquote>
		
		<p>From Wikipedia: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus' target='_blank'>Humunculus</a></p>
			<blockquote>Homunculus (masculine, Latin for "little man", plural: "homunculi"; from the diminutive of homo) is a term used, generally, in various fields of study to refer to any representation of a human being. Popularized in sixteenth century alchemy and nineteenth century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. The concept has roots in preformationism as well as earlier folklore and alchemic traditions. Currently, in scientific fields, a homunculus may refer to any scale model of the human body that, in some way, illustrates physiological, psychological, or other abstract human characteristics or functions.</blockquote></p>

		<p>The term homunculus ('little man') has a lengthy history. p50</p> 
		
		<p>Homunculus in:</p> 
		<ul> 
		  <li>Humanities : tends to mean slightly less than human - p50</li> 
		  <li>Science: tends to mean preformed in minimal way/indicate preformationism - p50</li> 
		</ul> 
		
		<p>Preformationism - the form was already present in some minimal way, offered a materialist/mechanistic solution to development. p50</p>
		
		<p>But: does not answer where the minimal form itself came from. p50</p>
		
		<p>Neurologists create images that map the brain to specific regions of the body. p50</p>
		
		<p>Maps are representations not the territory. Similar but not intrinsically meaningful. The 'reader', is extrinsic. p51</p> 
		
		<p>We need to know about the process of interpreting. Homunculus are unacknowledged gap-fillers. Can impede our efforts - p52</p> 
		
		<p>Koch and Crick / Butler <i>Erewhon</i>: invoke an homunculus. p52</p>
		
		<p>Homunculus ancestors were the gods and fairies. - p53</p> 
		
		<p>Homunculus in science today leads to misleading explanations, gap-fillers that obscure, gremlins that mask - p53</p> 
		
		<p>Aristotle's notion of <i>entelechy</i> - a formative principle that tends to realize itself - goal-directed. p53</p> 
		
		<p>Vitalism / <em>élan vital</em> are homucular at their core - p55</p> 
		
		<p>Homunculus is:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Descarte's <i>cogito</i></li>
		<li>the rational principle</li>
		<li>One's conscience</li>
		<li>One's inner voice</li>
		<li><i>many other descriptions to be added here...</i></li>
		<li>The property that distiniguishes the living from the non-living</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The thing that the homuculus has is that it has a life of its own. p55</p> 

	<h3>3 The vessel of teleology - p55</h3> 

		<p><i>This section:
		<ul>
			<li>Homunculus: a marker for what is not known. Homunculus = 'black box'</li>
			<li>Homunculus too easily forgotten.</li>

		<p>The homunculus is a challenge for science. It is the marker for what is not there, the ententional. p55</p> 

		<p>Homunculus not recognized, hidden, forgotten - not recognized for being placeholders
			This tendency perhaps derives from the familiarity of also not knowing the thoughts and motivations of the people around us. p56</p> 

		<p>The ententional gets forgotten. p56</p> 

		<p>The incredible shrinking homuculus. Science provides more &amp; more mechanistic explanations.
			Extrapolate and the homuculi all get replaced by complex mechanical explanations. [Go to zero?] p56</p> 
			
		<p>Why do ententional explanations tend to get eliminated?</p>
		<p>Teleological explanations point to a locus or origin but leave the mechanism of causal efficiency incomplete.
		
		<p>This it is difficult to ascribe energy, materiality or physical extension to the ententional. p57</p>	 

		<p>In this age of 'life is just chemistry', there is still no explanation on the origins of life and consciousness.
			Saying there are explanations is premature. p57</p> 
		
		<p>The homunculus symbolizes what science still cannot explain. The 'black box'. They are markers and can offer clues. p58</p>

	<h3>4 Hiding final cause - p58</h3>

		<hr>
		
		<p>In history: the homunculus is a placeholder for Aristotle's 'final causality'. p58</p>
		
		<p>All designed objects exist <i>in futuro</i> and are thus incomplete. p59</p>
		
		<p>Final causality is logically incoherent. Thought is a possible future and has no material existence - and is essentially homuncular. p59</p> 
		
		<p>Today, in science: The term homunculus has become prejorative - often applied to errors in thinking.</p>
		
		<p>But it is OK to use the homuculus, provisional homunculi, as a marker for unfinished business.
			- as long as there is full disclosure, recognized for what they ae, and slated for replacement ASAP. p60 </p>

		<p>Preformationist: material / at least some form of form is present from the get-go. p64</p>
