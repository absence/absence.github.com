	<h2>Book Summary</h2>
	
	<p>A concise summary of the book might go as follows:</p>
	
	<p><b><i>Incomplete Nature</i> sets out to resolve Descartes's mind-body problem using the scientific method.</b></p>
	
	<p>This statement can be divided into three parts: the philosophical part, the scientific part and the resolution.
	
	<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-body_problem' target='_blank'>mind-body problem</a> as follows:</p> 
	<blockquote>
	The mindâ€“body problem in philosophy examines the relationship between mind and matter, 
	and in particular the relationship between consciousness and the brain. 
	The question, as Colin McGinn puts it, is how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter.
	</blockquote>
	<p>Any resolution of the philosophical aspects must take into consideration the thinking of the major philosophical thinkers and tendencies.</p>
	
	<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method' target='_blank'>scientific method</a> as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>
	The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
	To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
	The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, 
	consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."
	</blockquote>
	<p>Any resolution of the scientific aspects of the problem account for that thought you just had 
	all the way down to whatever Higg's bosons may be in your brain or not in your brain as the case may be. 
	In between, topics such as how do insticts and language arise, how did inorganic become organic, 
	what was there before there was the second law of thermodynamics and much more must be addressed.</p>
	
	<p>In other words, the resolution of the mind-body problem must take into account eveything we know.</p>
	
	<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> attempts to bring together the concepts of what we do know from many sciences and blend them into a whole.</p>
	
	<p>But wait, wait. There's more!</p>
	
	<p>There's a lot we don't know. There's probably more out there that we don't know than that we do know.</p>
	
	<p>So, as Deacon might say, the book is about (w)holes - because there are so many holes in (y)our knowlesdge.</p> 
	
	<p><i>[or is this Deacon just being holier than thou? ;-]</i></p>
	
	<p><i>to be continued...</i></p>
