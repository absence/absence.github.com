<p>
<p>Emergence: (glossary)
<p>A term used to designate an apparently discontinuous transition from one mode of causal properties to another of a higher rank, typically associated with an increase in scale in which lower-order component interactions contribute global properties that appear irreducible to the lower-order interactions. 
<p>
<p>The term has a long and diverse history, but throughout this history it has been used to describe the way that living and mental processes depend upon chemical and physical processes, yet exhibit collective properties not exhibited by non-living and non-mental processes, and in many cases appear to violate the ubiquitous tendencies exhibited by these component interactions

<p>Such major transitions in the organization of things are often described as emergent, because they have the appearance of spontaneous novelty, as though they are poking their noses into our world from out of a cave of non-existence. And while they are not exactly something coming from nothing, they have a quality of unprecedented discontinuity about them—an almost magical aspect, like a rabbit pulled from an apparently empty hat.

<p>Each transition involves the formation of a higher-order structure or process out of the interrelationships of smaller, simpler components. Emergence in this sense involves the formation of novel, higher-order, composite phenomena with coherence and autonomy at this larger scale.

<p>The concept at the center of this critique has been a core issue for emergentism since the British emergentists’ first efforts to precisely articulate it. This is the concept of supervenience. Supervenience is in many respects the defining property of emergence, but also the source of many of its conceptual problems. The term was first used philosophically by Lloyd Morgan to describe the relationship that emergent properties have to the base properties that give rise to them.17 A more precise technical definition was provided by the contemporary philosopher Donald Davidson, who defines it in the context of the mind/body problem as follows: “there cannot be two events exactly alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects.”18

<p>
<p>A straightforward framing of this challenge to a mereological conception of emergence is provided by the cognitive scientist and philosopher Mark Bickhard. His response to this critique of emergence is that the substance metaphysics assumption requires that at base, “particles participate in organization, but do not themselves have organization.” But, he argues, point particles without organization do not exist (and in any case would lead to other absurd consequences) because real particles are the somewhat indeterminate loci of inherently oscillatory quantum fields. These are irreducibly processlike and thus are by definition organized. But if process organization is the irreducible source of the causal properties at this level, then it “cannot be delegitimated as a potential locus of causal power without eliminating causality from the world.”20

<p> But it shouldn’t have surprised us to find that a synchronic understanding of this relationship is an insufficient basis for the concept of emergence. For one reason, emergence itself is a temporal conception. Most if not all of the higher-order properties considered to be emergent were not always present in the universe, and not always present in the local contexts in which they currently exist.

<p>These emergent phenomena and their ententional properties emerged as new forms of physical-chemical process organization developed among the existing atoms and their energetic interactions. As they did so, new kinds of components also came into existence. Static notions of part and whole are for this reason suspect since the wholes we are interested in are dynamical and the parts are constantly in flux, being constantly synthesized, damaged, and replaced, while the whole persists.

<p>The concept of emergence began to take on a new meaning in the last years of the twentieth century. This reemergence of emergence as a major topic of study arose as a consequence of two related developments: the study of a variety of inorganic phenomena with distinctive and discontinuous changes in aggregate behavior due to lower-level dynamics; and the development of computational simulation techniques able to model complex iterative processes and highly non-linear dynamics.

<p>examples—offer a highly suggestive set of phenomena that satisfy the general criteria characterizing emergence: higher-order aggregate properties arising from the interactions of components lacking these properties. It is unlikely that the study of naturally occurring self-organization would have received the attention it did were it not for the insights gained from computation.

<p>These approaches have provided well-understood physical and mathematical exemplars of processes that produce complex regularities of global organization from unorganized and even randomly distributed interactions among components. Such processes are thoroughly non-mysterious and mechanistic. They generate spontaneous regularities and synergies at a global level that depend solely on cumulative interaction effects at a lower level. They are not consequences of extrinsic imposed regularity (such as containment) or the simple summation of intrinsic component properties (as is, say, mass or electric charge) or component dynamical properties (as is total heat). Many of the common descriptors used to characterize emergent phenomena also applied to these dynamical processes. The regularities observed at a higher level result from otherwise unorganized dynamical interactions of lower-level components. These regularities are not mere summations or superpositions of these lower-level properties, and exhibit properties that have no lower-level counterparts. And these higher-level properties are often incredibly difficult to predict, even knowing in detail the lower-level details. They are more often recognized simply by observation of consequences.

<p> these phenomena both offered numerous exemplars of processes where lower-order interactions gave rise to distinctive, unprecedented, higher-order consequences and offered powerful heuristic tools for developing an empirically grounded account of a whole class of emergent processes. Besides providing potentially informative exemplars, and the space necessary for a rethinking of the problem of emergence from a viewpoint unburdened by the baggage of metaphysical justification, there is another less obvious but more important contribution of this new conception of emergent process: it initiated a shift in perspective from part/whole to process conceptions of emergence. Following these developments in the physical and computational sciences, the concept of emergence has begun to take on a new and primarily descriptive meaning in many fields. This has done much to legitimate its usage, free of philosophical baggage.

<p>the associated concepts of novelty, unpredictability, ascent in scale, synergy, and so on, serving as the principal feature being highlighted. But a more troublesome consequence of identifying exemplars of emergent relationships in physical and computational processes is that it suggests that all examples of phenomena might be accounted for as members of this (albeit diverse) class of processes.

<p> “Mental states do not exist, any more than do flame states—both are processes.”23 This may be a bit too extreme, but it drives home a crucial point: these phenomena consist in the special character of the transformations between states, not in the constitution of things at any slice in time. So, trying to build a theory of the emergence of living or mental processes based on a synchronic conception of emergence theory is bound to fail from the beginning. The phenomena we are interested in explaining are intrinsically historical and dynamic. Being alive does not merely consist in being composed in a particular way. It consists in changing in a particular way. If this process of change stops, life stops, and unless all molecular processes are stopped as well (say by quick-freezing), the cells and molecules distinctive to it immediately begin to degrade.

<p>Even the simplest conscious cognitive act inevitably involves rapidly shifting, fleeting, and low-level metabolic changes across dozens of diverse brain regions—some increasing and some decreasing in metabolism at different moments in the process—in order to be completed.

<p>Ultimately, we will at least need to develop methods to track the second-by-second regional changes, and eventually even the systemic activities of thousands of interacting neurons, in order to have a methodology appropriate to the challenge. In other words, what we need to know are the relationships between brain system processes and cognitive processes. A process conception of emergence both resolves certain conceptual dilemmas associated with classic synchronic conceptions of emergence and poses new conceptual problems that were previously irrelevant.

<p>circularity. Because there are no material entities that are not also processes, and because processes are defined by their organization, we must acknowledge the possibility that organization itself is a fundamental determinant of physical causality. At different levels of scale and compositionality, different organizational possibilities exist. And although there are material properties that are directly inherited from lower-order component properties, it is clear that the production of some forms of process organization is only expressed by dynamical regularities at that level. So the emergence of such level-specific forms of dynamical regularity creates the foundation for level-specific forms of physical influence.

<p>
<p>This also signals a paradigm shift in what we take to be an emergent phenomenon. In fact, a process approach forces us to abandon the two pillars of classic emergence theory: supervenience and mereology. For example, the philosopher Timothy O’Connor argues that composition is not well defined for processes.25 This is because components may be continually changing (as in, say, a vortex or an organism) while the emergent attributes are persistent. Although the component elements in such processes are critical, the dynamics of their transitions are more so, and it is this pattern of change that is critical.

<p>And yet, even classic conceptions of emergence have an irreducible temporal aspect, because in most cases there was a time before and after an emergent transition. Many specific emergent features of the world have not always been around. Depending on what emergences we consider—for example, Morowitz’s list of cosmic emergence events, or maybe just the origins of life and mind—pretty much all of them are associated with a before and after. The role of temporal transition is relevant for the analogue of fusion as it applies to the molecules constituting an organism. The existence of these molecules is not explained without at least implicitly describing their origins in a prior phase of the process.

<p>But in this case, this hierarchic ontological dependency is tangled in what Douglas Hofstadter has called “strange loops.”26 Over the course of evolution, it is likely that there were modifications to essentially every molecular component found in a living organism.

<p>Bickhard’s and O’Connor’s defenses of a process conception of emergence only clear away assumptions that have been blocking progress. To accept this critique is to be enjoined to provide an alternative to these more classic conceptions of emergence that nonetheless achieves what they did not. So we must begin to consider how one would construct a theory of emergent processes that articulates the dynamical alternatives to the classic defining properties of mereological organization, supervenience, and causal inflection. These criteria define what the emergence of a new level of process entails. It specifically requires developing new criteria for defining hierarchically distinct dynamic regimes and their relationship to lower-level dynamic regimes. Although the relationship is in this sense loosely analogous to a supervenience relationship, in that higher-level dynamical regimes require lower-level dynamical regimes, it cannot be understood in terms of simple part/whole compositionality. Nor is the existence of lower-level properties explainable irrespective of higher-level properties. Higher-order processes are more accurately “nested” within lower-level dynamics as distinctive special cases. Thus, for example, the circular flow of a whirlpool is a special case of laminar flow of liquid and occurs as a local disturbance of this general flow pattern. What must be explained, then, is how the organization of a process can be a locus of a distinctive mode of causality that is independent of the patterns of causal interaction among individual components of that process. Beneath this question lies another that is even more basic: Isn’t organization merely a description of some relationships between components? Indeed, isn’t it inevitably a simplification and an abstraction? We must still ask whether there is something about the organization of a process that is causally relevant over and above lower-level processes and their causal influences. If organization is not an intrinsic property, but rather merely a comparative assessment or idealization, it is rendered physically epiphenomenal.

<p>
<p> This is relevant to the adequacy of reductionism for analyzing processes whose components are ultimately processes as well. Classic conceptions of emergence were specifically formulated as critiques of reductionism and eliminativism, and in particular they contested the priority of the very small. But framing emergence in dynamical terms does not necessarily favor either bottom-up or top-down priority of causal influence. As in the case of the interdependence of organization and compositionality of the biomolecules that constitute an organism, reductionistic analysis is both informative and yet only fully explanatory in the context of an evolved organism and its relevant environments. Reductive analysis that assumes this larger systemic context as a kind of unanalyzed boundary condition is in fact the typical case in the biological sciences. This is not simple reductionism, since the emergent features are already assumed. In conclusion, when it comes to the two classes of phenomena that we would be most willing to call emergent in a robust sense—life and mentality—the dependency between the dynamical regularities that bring them into being at different levels of scale is neither supervenient nor mereological. The nested and interdependent forms of process organization that characterize these ententional phenomena are not compositional in any clear sense, and do not yield to simple decompositional analysis. Processes are not decomposable to other simpler processes. Or, to put this in simpler terms: processes don’t have other processes as their parts.

<p> There is, however, another way to view the contribution of these dynamical systems insights. The shift to a dynamical perspective provides a way to explain the spontaneous generation of organization, despite the relentless dissolution of orderliness that is implicit in the second law of thermodynamics. Although dynamical order is not in itself ententional in any sense, all ententional phenomena are defined with respect to order, and so depend on the presence of organized processes for their existence. Perhaps the emergence of dynamical regularity from a context of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics can serve both as a stepping stone contributing to the emergence of ententional processes and as a model of the logic of emergent transitions in general.
