	<h2>Part 2 Summary ~ Chapters 6-10 ~ Outlining an Alternative Theory</h2> 
	
		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 2 as follows:</p>
		
		<blockquote>"I outline an alternative approachâ€”a theory of emergent dynamics that shows how dynamical process can become organized 
			around and with respect to possibilities not realized. 
			This is intended to provide the scaffolding for a conceptual bridge from mechanistic relationships 
			to end-directed, informational, and normative relationships such as are found in simple life forms."
		</blockquote>
		
		
	<h3>Current Status</h3>
	
		<p><i>2013-05-16 ~ The effort to summarize chapters 6-10 is still at a fairly early stage. 
			A first pass has been made that collects the key words and summarizes text section by section.
			Several more passes need to be made in order to bring the effort up to the level of part 1.
