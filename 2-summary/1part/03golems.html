	<h2>Chapter 3 ~ Golems</h2> 
		<p><i>Science does not dehumanize man, it de-homunculizes him</i> &mdash; B F Skinner, 1971</p>
		
		<p>From the <i>Incomplete Nature</i> glossary:</p>
		<blockquote>Golem: In Jewish folklore a golem is an animated, anthropomorphic being, created entirely from inanimate matter but lacking a soul</blockquote>
		
		<p>From Wikipedia: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem' target='_blank'>Golem</a></p>
		<blockquote>In Jewish folklore, a golem is an animated anthropomorphic being, created entirely from inanimate matter. 
		The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing.</blockquote>

		<p>In our daily life we homuncularize on a regular, natural basis - without thinking. </p>
			
<!--
How do homuncularize ans abstracting relate to each other?
-->			

		<p>We imagine multiple outcomes. We anthropomorphize the inanimate. p80</p>
		
		<p>We homuncularize without thinking. Even careful theorists do it... p80</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism: the position that any ententional phenomenon are merely heuristic place holders 
			and can/must be eliminated from science and replaced by mechanistic methods.</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism tends to sacrifices completeness for consistency - misses out on all the ententional aspects. p81</p>

		<p>Daniel Dennet: An effort to deny ententional processes and reference to teleological phenomena
		in one location only serves to displace these functional roles to other places. p81</p>
		
		<p>Homunculi are stand-ins for incomplete explanations. p81</p>

		<p>Example: homuculi become little men becomes </i>&eacute;lan vital</i>. p82</p>
		
		<p>A similarity is drawn to Hercules cutting off the head of the Hydra only to have
		two new heads appear. p82</p>

		<p>Eliminative materialism posits that homuncli will go away with further research
		and/or being proved to be fictional to begin with. p83</p>

		<p>Fractionation is a common strategy to reduce complex phenomena into simpler component
		features</p>

		Interesting insight begins here. Interestingly, it's only used here and and not used again later in the book.

		<p>Reducible systems - only depend on ability to identify graininess in complex phenomena
		/ capacity to study properties of subdivisions / as distinct from collective phenomenon
		that they compose. p85</p>

		<p>Decomposable systems - additionally requires subdivisions to exhibit properties
		they exhibit in the whole / even if entirely isolated and independent of it. p85</p>

		<p>A clock is both reducible and decomposable to its parts, whereas a living organism
		may be analytically reducible, but it is not decomposable. p85</p>

		<p>While ententional phenomena are dependent on physical substrate relationships,
		they are not decomposable to them, only to lower-order ententional phenomena. p85</p>

		<p>This is because although ententional phenomena are necessarily physical, their
		proper parts are not physical parts. p85</p>
		
		<p>In dividing our problems into smaller bits, we multiply the mysteries. p86</p>

		<p>Homunculus: an avatar of cryptic ententional properties smuggled into our theories, p86</p>
		
		<p>Golem as the avatar of its opposite: apparently mindlike processes that are nonetheless
		devoid of their own ententional properties. p86</p>

		<p>If a homunculus is a little man in my head, then the golem is a hollow-headed
		man, a zombie. p86</p>

		<p>A golem is often proposed as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a thoroughly eliminative
		materialism view. p87</p>

		<p>Vast majority of our moment-to-moment behaviors - including belies, desires and
		purposes - are not associated with consciousness - and is thus zombie/golem-like<. p87/p>

		<p>Besides being a soulless being, following commands with mechanical dispassion,
		the golem lacks discernment. p88</p>

		<p>The golems of today are not artificial living beings, but rather bureaucracies,
		legal systems, and computers. In their design as well as their role as unerringly
		literal slaves, digital computers are the epitome of a creation that embodies truth
		maintenance made animate. p89</p>

		<p>Computers are logic embodied in mechanism. The development of logic was the result
		of reflection on the organization of human reasoning processes. It is not itself
		thought, however, nor does it capture the essence of thought, namely, its quality
		of being about something. Logic is only the skeleton of thought: syntax without
		semantics. p89</p>

		<p>The golem nature of logic comes from its fixity and closure. Logic is ultimately
		a structure out of time. It works to assure valid inference because there are no
		choices or alternatives. So the very fabric of valid deductive inference is by
		necessity preformed. p89</p>

		<p>This logico-mathematical-machine equivalence was formalized in reverse when Alan
		Turing showed how, in principle, every valid mathematical operation that could
		be precisely defined and carried out in a finite number of steps could also be
		modeled by the actions of a machine. p90</p>

		<p>To simplify a bit, the problem lies in the very assumption that syntax and semantics,
		logic and representation, are independent of one another. A golem is syntax without
		semantics and logic without representation. There is no one at home in the golem
		because there is no representation possible no meaning, no significance, no value,
		just physical mechanism, one thing after another with terrible inflexible consistency. p92</p>

		<p>We might suspect, then, that whenever we encounter a golem, there is a hidden
		homunculus, a man behind the curtain, or a rabbi and his magical incantations pulling
		the nearly invisible strings. p93</p>

		 <p>60's Behaviorism movement almost killed psychology. Thoughts and experiences: taboo. 
		 But was first systematic approach to slaying the homunculus fallacy by replacing notions with observations</p>
		 <p>70's Cognitive science - mixes psychology, philosophy, computation <i>et al</i> - treats mental processes as vast array of computer algorithms. 
		 But finds no place for consciousness - heck, consciousness might not even exist.</p>
		 <p>Thus, if scientists could map every possible human thought or action to an equivalent computer circuit or algorithm, wouldn't this be good enough?</p>

		<p>Computational theory of mind: the manipulation of tokens completely describes thinking.</p>
		<p>Alogrithm: a set of instructions to generate a process that achieves a particular consequence.</p>
		<p>But don't specify all the details. Just like words on this page - there needs to be an interpreter.</p>
		<p>Consider Gary Kasparov playing chess against the computer Big Blue. Big Blue is but a collection of homuculi - human thoughts stored in a box. 
		It resembles the unconscious more than the conscious.</p>
		<p>Is the human mind ultimately just a computer? ...</p>
		<p>But, if so, how did it learn? How can 'simple' become more 'complex'? How did it evolve?</p>
		<p>And when and how does cognition come into the process? </p>
		<p>Note that cognition has to be intrinsic/come from with - not extrinsic/come from the outside.</p>
		<p>Computer bugs provide a clue. The process of maintaining/surviving as yet unknown errors may provide some clues.</p>
		<p>Computers made of meat (us) are messy and imprecise. Just what the doctor ordered.</p>
