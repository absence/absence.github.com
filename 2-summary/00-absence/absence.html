	<h2>Chapter 0 ~ Absence</h2> 
	<p><em>In the history of culture, the discovery of zero will always stand out as one of the greatest single achievements of the human race. —Tobias Dantzig, 1930</em> </p> 
		<h3>The missing cipher - p1</h3>

			<p>The current scientific <em>Theory of Everything</em> is implies that: &quot;we don’t exist, except as collections of atoms.&quot;</p> 
			
			<p>Consider the sentences you are now reading:
				The meaning is not in the squiggles, not in the sounds made, not even in the neurons being fired in your brain</p>
				
			<p>These sentences lacks the properties that normally cause things to happen. 
				Information has no mass, momentum, charge, no solidity, no presence of any sense.
				Moreover these sentences could even be nonsense and have no correspondence to reality. 
				Nevertheless if that nonsense caused you to wonder, it could still influence the way you act.
				</p>	
			
			<p>Despite the surreal aspects, These sentences were written to convey a meaning. 
			And you are expending effort in order to receive this information.</p>
			
			<p>Thus, there's something not-there there. And what is not there may have physical consequences.</p> 
			
			<p>What is absent matters. Longings, desires, passion, appetite, mourning, aspiration 
			are all ideas about things not present or that don't exist and have no physical attributes - but these are the stuff of life.</p>
			
			<p>A shovel is not just a shovel. And it's not a hole in the ground. Yet it is a method of creating holes more easily.</p>
			
			<p>A defining property of life and mind, a causal role for absence seems to be absent from the natural sciences.</p> 
			
			<p>Definition [page:Absential Absential] features: phenomena whose existence are determined with respect to an essential absence.</p> 
			
			<p>A complete theory of the world must make sense of what is not there and how that affects what is there.</p>

			<p>Most of science focuses on the things that are actual and present. Therefore science is reductionist.</p> 
			
			<p>Yet the mind-body dilemma continues. Something is missing.</p>
