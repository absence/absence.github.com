<h2>Teleodynamics</h2> 
    <p>Teleodynamics - glossary</p>
    <p>A form of dynamical organization exhibiting end-directedness and consequence-organized
      features that is constituted by the co-creation, complementary constraint, and
      reciprocal synergy of two or more strongly coupled morphodynamic processes</p>

        <li>a dynamical form of organization that promotes its own persistence and maintenance
          by modifying this dynamics to more effectively utilize supportive extrinsic conditions.</li>
        <li>not identifiable with any particular constituents, or even any constituent morphodynamic
          process.</li>
        <li>organized with respect to its own persistence</li>
        <li>&nbsp;not bound to specific material substrates or component dynamical process</li>
