	<h2>Chapter 5 ~ Emergence</h2>
	<p><i>... we need an account of the material world in which it isnâ€™t absurd to claim that it produced us. 
		&mdash;translated and rephrased by the Terence Deacon from Ilya Prigogine and Isabella Stengers, 1979</i></p>
    
	<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> glossary definition: <b>Emergence</b>: A term used to designate an apparently discontinuous transition from one mode of causal properties to another of a higher rank, 
		typically associated with an increase in scale in which lower-order component interactions contribute global properties 
		that appear irreducible to the lower-order interactions. 
		The term has a long and diverse history, but throughout this history it has been used to describe the way 
		that living and mental processes depend upon chemical and physical processes,
		yet exhibit collective properties not exhibited by non-living and non-mental processes, 
		and in many cases appear to violate the ubiquitous tendencies exhibited by these component interactions.</p>
		
	<p>Wikipedia definition: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence' target='_blank'>Emergence</a>:  
		In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise 
		out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions. 
		Emergence is central to the theories of integrative levels and of complex systems.

	<h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
	<p><i>
		This chapter characterizes the term 'emegergence':  
		its emergence in the 19th century, de-emergence in the late 20th century and more recent re-emergence.<br>
		Question: how does stuff learn new things without a teacher? Answer: stuff emerges.<br>
		Physics: emergence is relatively new phenomena in the universe.<br>
		Philosophy: although thought about by the Greeks, emergence brought to forefront by Darwin and natural selection.<br>
		History: British Emergentists (reductionists) - reduced to ashes by Jaegwon Kim [at Oxford University btw]. <br>
		Philosophy: Davidson: No higher order event occurs without concomittant change at lower order.<br>
		Two types of emergence: 1. inorganic whole is sum of parts and 2. organic whole is greater than the sum of the parts.<br>
		Parodying the GE slogan: 'With general emergence: process is our most important product.'</i>

		<p><i>This section: characterizes emergence as an unnatural, recent, unpredictable, hierarchy of observable phenomena.</i></p>
		
		<p>The transition from inorganic appears to contravene the the laws of thermoodynamics. </p>
		
		<p>For most of the 13 billion years of the universe, the universe has not had ententional properties. p144</p>

		<p>Ententional properties appear to have came out of nowhere, nevertheless must have obeyed the laws of physics.</p>
		
		<p>Emergence: spontaneous novelty / radical unprecedented changes/discontinuities / newness/unpredictable /almost like magic.</p>
		
		<p>Emergence: appears hierarchic/coherent/harmonious / higher order structure or process arising from lower order</p>
		
		<p>Harold Morowitz: identified a hierarchy of over twenty 'emergences' of higher order out of smaller/simpler components. p144</p>
		
		<p>All representations are simplifications. Many transitions are beyond our present capability to represent - therefore remain unpredictable. p145</p>
		
		<p>Emergent phenomena have distinctive ententional characteristics - but only make sense with respect to non-intrinsic relationships. p146/p>
		
		<p>Proving ultimate unpredictability or causation is not as important as removing the mysteries/lesser unpredictabilities (gaps in our knowldedge)

		<p><i>This section: covers the history of emergence from its emergence in the 19th century. 
			Darwin's discovery of natural selection trashes teleology - there was a causer, introduces mechanistic thinking - everyehere.
			Dilemma: how can the mind - which is teologic - be explained to derive from non-teleogic origins? 
			Historically one might say that emergence is now seen as being at the end of its beginning.<br>
			Topics covered: history, biology, philosophy</i></p>	
		
		<p>Emergence appears in the 19th century. 
			Darwin's natural selection spurs Herbert Spencer to consider simililar principles for psychology and sociology.</p>	
		
		<p>Nature became viewed through lens of materialism. Teleology and metaphysics were trashed by science.</p>	
		
		<p>But how to explain the evelotiont of the teleologic nature of life and mental process?</p>	
		
<!-- I wish Deacon spent a bit more time or had a clearer explanation here.. -->	
	
		<p>If entetional properties are not already part of the inorganic world, how could such features be derived from or grow out of the inorganic? p146</p>	
		
		<p>Ententional could not be part of foundation [intrinsic] nor could they be denied.</p>	
		
		<p>Energence: an in-between stage, an intermediate position.</p>
		
		<p>George Henry Lewes in <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i> (1874-9) first defines emergence. 
			Lewes appears to have been influenced by John Stuart Mill/<i>A System of Logic</i> and the discontinuities of chemical reactions. 
			The end result being greater/different than the sum of the parts. p147</p>
			
		<p>Earlier John Locke/late 1600s had accounted for complex ideas arising out of 'atoms' of experience.
			Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck theorize in a similar manner regarding nature. p146</p>
			
		<p>George Batsen explains how Lamarck turns philosophy inside out: 
			The 'Mind at the top' alters from being the explainer of all things to being the thing that needs explaining.</p>

		<p>Teleology becomes the result of life, no longer its cause.</p>
		
		<p>Key event: 1959 Charles Darwin's <i>On the Origin of the Species</i>. p150</p>
		
		<p>Goal-seeking organisms not required. Teleology may be dispensed with. Natural selection = statistics.</p>
		
		<p>Functional design can be seen as a law-like process - no magic tricks needed. p150</p>
		
		<p>Alfred Russel Wallace (co-discoverer of natural selection) and others believed that 
			the process of natural selection could be applied to human experience as well. p151</p>
			
		<p>If something as complex as the human body can arrive at the roll of the dice,
			then why is teleology needed to explain human cognition?</p>	
			
		<p>19th century emergentism can be viewed as an effort to rescue human teleology.</p>

		<p>Emergemtism a response to another 19th century theory: Reductionism.</p>
		
		<p>Reductionism: complicated phenomena may be be better understood by separating them into component parts.</p>
		
		<p>The whole may be understood as the interaction of the parts. An extension to Atomism - keep dividing things until you get to the smallest bit.</p>
		
		<p>But: you never reach the indivisible. There's no stopping it.</p>
		
		<p>Thomas Hobbs: even human interaction may be reduced to the study of bodies in motion.</p>
		
		<p>Robert Wilson: termed the approach 'smallism' the smaller the more fundamental.</p>

		<p>Many profound successes: DNA, chemistry, physics, neuroscience...p>		
         
		<p>Not always clear that things become simpler as they become smaller. Things/processes don't always decompose gracefully</p>
		
		<p>Smallism focuses attention away from interaction complexity. p153</p>
		
		<p>Provides false impression: analyzing the overall organization may be less important than studying the components.</p>
		
		<p>Recently, according to people like Stephen Hawking: Complexity and interaction dynamics have started coming into focus.</p>

		<p><i>This section: Deep parsing of the history of emergence - especially the British Emergentists. 
			The notio of constraints is introduced. 
			What will emerges in this book is that there are two types of emergence - typified by inorganic and organic matter.
			Inorganic matter is the sum of its parts. Organic matter is beyond the sum of its parts. 
			<br>
			Topics covered: history, biology, philosophy</i></p>		
		
		<p>British emegentists (Alexander, Broad, Morgan <i>et al</i>): theorize a middle path between reductionism and vitalism. p154</p>
		
		<p>Influenced by J S Mill: summing up the parts is not good enough. Just look at chemistry where combining two gasses can create a solid. p154</p>
		
		<p>Must distinguish higher level from lower level properties by non-additive forms of interaction.</p>
		
		<p>Mill defines homopathic (additive, highly predictable) and heteropathic (bridging, idiosyncratic) laws. 
			Higher level properties not discontinuous from lower level, just not predictable using lower level laws. p155</p>
			
		<p>Morgan: evolution could be more than merely incremental - sometimes there are unprecedented transitions. p156</p>	
		
		<p>Motivation for emergence thinking: explain the gap between hard science excluding ententional and soft science cannot ignore. p157</p>
		
		<p>Alexander and Broad: low level can be ground for non-mechanistic emergent properties at a higher level. p157</p>
		
		<p>Broad: Emergence requires an observer. Even with complete description of lower order, one cannot predict higher order. p158</p>
		
		<p>Alexander: Must accept emergent transitions as fact - despite human limits/current knowledge of inability to explain, 
			not because of fundamental incompatibility. Laplaciam demon could predict much but not all. Some transitions are beyond computation. p158</p>
		
		<p>More questions than answers. Descriptions not explanations deriving from first principles. p158</p>
		
		<p>Strong and weak emergentism. p158</p>
		
		<p>Note: <i>Incomplete Nature</i> goes beyond current emergent theories.<p>
		
		<p>Concept of emergence is used in other disciplines: See Weiss/biology and Bertanalaffy. p159</p>
		
		<p>Roger Sperry, 1980: updates the thinking with a configurational view of emergence. p159</p>
		
		<p>Example: atoms that happen to be part of a wheel move around more than atoms not oart of a wheel.</p>
		
		<p>Downward causation: being a part in a whole alters the options available, 160</p>	
		
		<p>Comment: Downward causality: like Aristotle's efficient cause 
			- important determinent in causality 
			- all wrapped in confusion because of simplistic dated thinking will be re-eamined later in biik in more detail. p161 </p>
			
		<p>Example: quantum properties swallowed up in transition to higher scale. 
			See collapse of SchrÃ¶dinger wave function. p162</p>	
		
		<p>Paul Humphreys: fusion destroys the evidence - parts cease to exist.
			
		<p>Notion of constraints introduced. p163</p>
		
		<p>The notion of change in lower-level constraints differs for Sperry's wheel and Humphrey's orgamisn.</p>
		
		<p>In wheel: invidual mobility of atoms is lost but mass and charge are unaffected. in organism, properties of molecules are altered.</p>
		
		<p>Two orders of emergent transition described: 
		<ul>
			<li>inorganic: whole is the sum of the parts organization. </li>
			<li>organic: exhibit emergence of ententional organisation</li>
		</ul>	
			p163
		</p>	

		<p>The organic cannot be taken apart and put back together - see Humpty Dumpty</p>

		<p><i>This section: describes Kim's critiques of emergentist theories. 
			Nevertheless some parts may have a meronic validity, but even these have issues. 
			If it's organized all the way down, and nothing above can happen without without something below having happened, then how can anything emerge? 	
			So alternative ideas regarding emergence are needed - especially one that take time into consideration - a dynamic systems approach.<br>
			Topics covered: philosophy, quantum mechanics</i></p>		
		
		<p>Issue with emergence theories: possibility of double counting leading to infinite regression: An end result causing itself.</p>
		
		<p>Jaegwon Kim challenges the popular assumptions of emergentists - forcing us to think outside the box. </p>
		
		<p>Kim's critique based on a core issuee of emergence: supervenience</p>

		<p>Donald Davidson defines:there cannot be two things that are physically identical but differ in some mental respects. 
			Or an object cannot alter some mental respect without altering in some physical aspect. </p>
			
		<p>Or there cannot be a change of thought without a change at the neuronal level.</p>

		<p>If so, then every possible higher order property is dependent on a lower order property but then nothing can ever emerge.</p>
		
		<p>No difference in the whole is possible without a difference in the parts. 
			Therefore how could there be something in the whole that is not reducible to a combination of properties of the parts?</p>
		
		<p>The part/whole study is critical and has pre-Socratic origins. See also mereology.</p>

		<p>Kim uses mereology principle of defining parts and wholes so as to avoid double counting. p165</p>
		
		<p>Functionalism, form and multiple realizibility. p166</p>
		
		<p>Substance metaphysics.</p>
		
		<p>Alternative needed.</p>
		
		<p>Example: quantum physics: there no 'atoms'/ultimate small particle down there - just quantum fields.</p>
		
		<p>Mereology only begins to succeed at a Newtonian level after statistical regularity of quantum fields have been taken into account.
		
			Remember this is just an example of failure, not itself leading towards a solution. p167</p>
			
		<p>Mark Bickhard: to say that particles participate in organization, but are not themselves organized is pointless. 
			Particle behavior is process-like and thus by definition organized. p187</p>	
			
		<p>If it's [turtles;-] organized all the way down, and nothing above can happen without without something below having happened, then how can anything emerge?</p>

		<p>Another issue is synchronicity. Higher order properties were not always present. Life and mind are just about brand new in the universe. 
			Emergence is emergent.</p>

		<p>Looking at emergence as an ongoing dynamic system helps, so do the many new type of exemplars of emergence as well as new tools.</p>

		<p><i>This section: The development of computer algorithms in the late 20thC lead to emergence of genetics and AI 
			This lead to re-emegence of emergence as a topic of interest..\<br>
			Topics covered: Computation, mathematics, physics</i></p>		

		<p>20th century: two reasons emergence reemerges: 1. organizations discovered within inorganic phenomena, 2. advent of computer simulations. </p>
		
		<p>Unlikely the former would have recived the attention without development of the latter 
			because computer controls enabled innumerable iterations upon the substrate enabling quasi-regularities to be identified.</p>
			
		<p>Graphic representations of such processes enabled a perception of the process by humans.</p>

		<p>These computer simulations became interesting in their own right - which led to the emergence of algorithms <i>cellular automata</i>.</p>
		
		<p>Famous 1960s examples: John Conway's <i>Game of Life</i> demos emergence. 
			See also work by Stuart Kaufman on connecting cells and Steven Wolfram on physical processes</p>
		
		<p>The underlying algorithms produce non-linear results, but they are recursive</p>
		
		<p>The solutions can be mapped out as a phase space - with trajectories of changing values. 
			The solutions are not entirely regular but are not entirely chaotic either.</p>
		
		<p>Trajectories tend to orbit particular zones, such a structure is termed an attractor.</p>
		
		<p>Famous example: Edward Lorenz 1960s: Lorenz attractor an example of deterministic chaos</p>
		
		<p>[Disclaimer: This author was romantically attracted to Professor Lorenz's daughter in the 1960s.]</p>
		
		<p>Spawns many types of investigation: complexity theory, chaos theory, synergetics, complex systems theory and others.</p>
		
		<p>Two have become prominent: 1. genetic algorithms. 2. artificial intelligence.</p>
		
		<p>These emergent processes are: 
		<ul>
		<li>Non-mysterious</li> 
		<li>Mechanistic</li>
		<li>Generate spontaneous regularities</li>
		<li>Not dependent on anything extrinsic</li>
		<li>Not a summation of intrinsic components</li>
		<li>Exhibit properties that have no lower-level counterparts</li>
		<li>Exhibit no end directed organization</li>
		<li>Can be described as emergent</li>
		<li>Provide a shift of perspective.</li>
		<li>Uncluttered with historical baggage</li>
		<li>Shifting the term 'emergence' from philosophical term to a more general usage </li>
		<li>Handy as intuition pumps</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>Caveats: the meaning of the word 'emergence' continues to emerge and emergengce is presumed to have emerged in places it actually did not.</p>

		<p>Emergence is not a structure but a process.</p>
		
		<p>Mark Bikhard: Emergence is not because something is composed in a particular way, but because it changes in a particular way. 
			If the process of life stops, life stops.</p>
		
		<p>Mind cannot be explained by neurons alone but by the processes that are occurring - which happen in many regions of the brain</p>

		<p>To understand we will need to know the relationships between brain system processes and cognitive thought processes.</p>
		
		<p>Note: Considering brain as process only removes roadblocks - further explaining still needed.</p>
