	<h2>Chapter 5 ~ Emergence</h2>
	<p><i>. . . we need an account of the material world in which it isn’t absurd to claim that it produced us. 
		—translated and rephrased by the Terence Deacon from Ilya Prigogine and Isabella Stengers, 1979</i></p>
    
	<p>Glossary definition</p>
	<p><b>Emergence</b>: A term used to designate an apparently discontinuous transition from one mode of causal properties to another of a higher rank, 
		typically associated with an increase in scale in which lower-order component interactions contribute global properties 
		that appear irreducible to the lower-order interactions. 
		The term has a long and diverse history, but throughout this history it has been used to describe the way 
		that living and mental processes depend upon chemical and physical processes,
		yet exhibit collective properties not exhibited by non-living and non-mental processes, 
		and in many cases appear to violate the ubiquitous tendencies exhibited by these component interactions.</p>

		<p><i>This section: characterizes emergence as a recent, unpredictable, hierarchy of phenomena.</i></p>
		
		<p>For most of the 13 billion years of the universe, the universe has not had ententional properties.</p>

		<p>Ententional properties appear to have came out of nowhere, nevetheless must have obeyed the laws of physics.</p>
		
		<p>Emergence: spontaneous novelty / almost like magic.</p>
		
		<p>Harold Morowitz: identified a hierachy of over twenty 'emergences' of higher order out of smaller/simpler components.</p>
		
		<p>All representations are simplifications. Many transitions are beyound our capability to represent - therefore remain unpredictible.</p>
		
		<p>Proving ultimate unpredictabiliy is not as important as important as removing the mysteries/lesser unpredictabilities (gaps in our knowldege) 
			that cause new types of order to emerge</p>
		
		<p>Question: which are the correct things to question?</p>
