	<h3>Objective for the book</h3>
	
	<p>The objective for <i>Incomplete Nature</i> is to:</p>
	<p><b>Resolve Descarte's mind-body problem based upon the scientific method.</b></p>
	
	<p>This statement can be divided into three parts: the philosophical part, the scientific part and the resolution.
	
	<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-body_problem' target='_blank'>mind-body problem</a> as follows:</p> 
	<quote>The mind–body problem in philosophy examines the relationship between mind and matter, 
	and in particular the relationship between consciousness and the brain. 
	The question, as Colin McGinn puts it, is how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter.</quote>
	
	<p>Any resolution of the philosophical aspects must take into consideration the thinking of the major philosophical thinkers and tendencies.</p>
	
	<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method' target='_blank'>scientific method</a> as follows:</p>
	<quote>The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
	To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
	The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, 
	consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.</quote>
	
	<p>Any resolution of the scientific aspects of the problem must be able to take into account that thought you just had 
	all the way down to whatever Higg's bosans may be in your brain or not in your brain as the case may be. 
	In between, topics such as how do insticts and language arise, how did inorganic become organic, 
	what was there before there was the second law of thermodynamics and more more must be addressed.</p>
	
	<p>In other words, the resolution of the mind-body problem must take into account eveything we know.</p>
	
	<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> is an attempt to bring together the concepts of what we do know from many sciences into a whole.</p>
	
	<p>But wait, wait. There's more!</p>
	
	<p>There's a lot we don't know. There's probably more out there that we don't know than that we do know.</p>
	
	<p>So, as Deacon might say, the book is about (w)holes - because there are so many holes in our knowlesdge.</p>

    <h3>Book Parts</h3> 
    <p>Deacon says the book is divided into three parts. The three parts are described as follows:</p> 
    <h3>Part 1 ~ Chapters 1-5 ~ Outlining the Problem</h3> 
    <p>&quot;I show that the conceptual riddles posed by absential phenomena have not been
      dealt with, despite claims that they have been overcome, but rather that they have
      been swept under the rug in various ingenious ways. By critiquing the history of
      efforts to explain them or explain them away, I argue that our various efforts
      have only served to insinuate these difficulties more cryptically into our current
      scientific and humanistic paradigms.&quot;</p> 
    <h3>Part 2 ~ Chapters 6-10 ~ Outlining an Alternative Theory</h3> 
    <p>&quot;I outline an alternative approach—a theory of emergent dynamics that shows how
      dynamical process can become organized around and with respect to possibilities
      not realized. This is intended to provide the scaffolding for a conceptual bridge
      from mechanistic relationships to end-directed, informational, and normative relationships
      such as are found in simple life forms.&quot;</p> 
    <h3>Part 3 ~ Chapters 11-17 ~ Exploring the Implications</h3> 
    <p>&quot;Having laid the groundwork for an expanded science capable of encompassing these
      basic absential relations, I explore a few of the implications for reformulating
      theories of work, information, evolution, self, sentience, and value. This is a
      vast territory, and in these final chapters I only intend to hint at the ways that
      this figure/background shift in perspective necessarily reformulates how these
      fundamental concepts need to be reconsidered.&quot;</p>
