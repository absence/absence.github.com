<h2>Chapter 4 ~ Teleonomy</h2> 

<p><i>Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.</i> —J B S Haldane
</p>
    
<p>A <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology' target='_blank'>Teleology</a>: is any philosophical account that holds that final causes exist in nature, meaning that design and purpose analogous to that found in human actions are inherent also in the rest of nature.</p>

	<p><i>This section: living things seem to violate the laws of nature: entropy rules. But It;s not really a law. And what's causing this?</i></p>
	
    <p>Rudolf Clausius/1865: Entropy - the tendency in nature for things to fall apart.</p>
    <p>Second law of thermodynamics: all other things being equal: entropy will go for broke.</p>
    <p>Thus: Life and thinking - order and organization - are quite unnatural/appear to violate a universal law.</p>
    <p>Loophole: Second law is a tendency - but not a necessity. There's room to wiggle here.</p>
    <p>In life: Time reversal appears implicit as is Aristotle's 'final cause'.</p>
    <p>What's the cause of this?</p>

	<p><i>This section: As part of the process of natural selection, organisms adapt: Law of effect. Replaces teleology </i></p>
	
    <p>We know of functions as part of the process of design. Darwin taught us that functions may emerge spontaneously.</p>
    
    <p>Daniel Dennet: logic of natural selection defeats claims that teleogy is necessary to explain complexity of biology</p>
    
    <p>Theory of natural selection = statistics</p>
    
    <p>Darwin: organisms - 1. reproduce, 2, diverge, 3. produce surfeit. Process generating inequalities. Differs with Lamarck's acquired characteristics.</p>
    
    <p>Darwin's discovery/<i>Descent of Man</i>: logic of natural selection is <i>after-the-fact</i>. Favorable outcomes preferentially reproduced, retained or expressed. 
      How these are generated matters not.</p>
    
    <p>Edward Thorndike's Law of effect: organisms adapt their behavior to their environment.</p>
    
    <p>Why did it take so long to discover? Humans are designers. Easier to think there's a supreme designer than to intuit the spontaneity.</p>
    
    <p>Empedocles: orderliness may arrive spontaneously - by preserving accidents. Only combinations that produce balance/fitness likely to persist.</p>
    
    <p>Aristotle disses Empedocles. How could the order and beauty we see be merely accidental? There's an <i>entelechy</i> lurking.</p>
        
    <p>Darwin's thoughts: provoked by Malthus, supervene Larmarck. Mechanisms for reproducing and preserving are entirely separable.</p>

    <p>Jacques Monod's <i>Chance and Necessity</i>: systems of molecular biology may be explained without final causality.</p>

	<p><i>This section: life is more than a machine - needs a term of expressionL Teleonomy. 
		Implies law-like behavior. Teleological in name only. A psudopurpose. This begs Teleomatic.
		But how closely do these terms map to reality?
		</i></p>
	
	<p> Machines require assembly. Organisms develop spontaneously. Though they appear similar, they are opposites.</p>
	
	<p>Ernst Mayer/1974: we should avoid confusing the two. Nevertheless both can be understood as thoroughly mechanistic - an exception: life itself.</p>
	
	p>Van Quine: Darwin shows that nature needs no final cause - she can be explained by physics and chemistry.</p>
	
	<p>Colin Pittendrigh/1958: <i>teleonomy</i>: law-like behavior, asymmetric, predictive.</p>
	
	<p>A mechanical process can be organized so it converges towards a specific state. Note: This is NOT behavior for the the sake of the end state.</p>
	
	<p>Teleonomy: target-directed, but behavior agnostic, consequence-blind, accident-driven</p>
	
	<p>Teleonomy: itself an accident, a mechanism.</p>

	<p>Example: the thermostat (in a Bateson-like manner): it behaves precisely how a purpose-driven human would behave.</p>

	<p>Example: Old Faithful: shows a teleonomic mechanism can arise by accident.</p>

	<p>Thus: it/we/them may all be an accident.</p>

	<p>Now consider human body temperature regulation: similar to thermostat, maintains a temperature.</p>

	<p>But body temperature is not just any arbitrary temperature, it is the most suitable temperature for a variety of metabolic processes to operate optimally</p>
	
	<p>Mayr: 'A teleonomic process or behavior is one which owes its goal-directedness to the operation of the program.'</p>	
	
	<p>BTW: But do not confuse an extrinsic abstract description with something that is intrinsic.</p>	
	
	<p>Mayr: Teleomatic: end-directed, in a passive automatic way, regulated by external forces or conditions.</p>	
	
	<p>BTW: Teleology, teleonomic, teleomatic: now widely accepted.</p>	
	
	<p>BTW: But which is the cause: human design, natural selection or happy accident?</p>
	
	<p>Many adaptive features, embedded in an organism, exist because of the contribution to something else.</p>	
	
	<p>Is a teleonomic mechanism that helps preserve a larger system to persist and reproduce the same as a mechanism generated by accident?</p>

	<p><i>This section outlines various areas where natural selection has been seen to replace teleology.</i></p>

	<p>A success for Law of Effect: Humoral immune response.</p>

	<p>Common sense suggested immune response was a blank slate - ready to accept what was presented to it</p>

	<p>reality: in pre-natal state hypermutation produces vast array of forms. 
		Later, when exposed to disease, with a bit of luck some of these forms bind with the enemy. 
		If it fits, this is the signal to make more of the same.</p>

	<p>Most will never bu used. Fit is only approximate. No information is acquired.</p>

	<p>B F Skinner and behaviorism: spontaneous exploratory behavior analogous to genetic variation. 
		Reward or punishment analogous to selection pressures.
		Habit formation or extinction analogous to differential reproduction</p>

	<p>Karl Popper's evolutionary epistemology; progressive adaptation of scientific knowledge to its empirical subject matter.</p>

	<p>Donald T Campbell's blind variation and selective retention.</p>

	<p>Gerald Edelman: start with an overabundance  of neurons and connections. Keep the ones that best reflect converging signal correlations.</p>

	<p>Artifical life: computer simulation of natural selection or unnatural selection. Teleogy free - though parameters are extrinsically determined.  But remember it's only a game.</p>

	<p>This section is about replication and natural selection at the molecular level.
		Dawkins provides a reasonable caricature of genes(software) and organisms(hardware) as an information processing system.</p>
		But an orgamism is not a assembly of parts. An organism grows. Different kettle of fish.
		Thus Dawkin's and other people's analysis - based on machine paradigms - are are either over-simplifications or incomplete or smuggle in patterns - thus creating numerous homunculi.
	</p>	

	<p>DNA and RNA mean that life may be understood in the terns of information processing. 'Algorithms appears to be a reasonable caricature.</p>
	
	<p>Even evolution may  be explained in these terms with he introduction of errors into the code.</p>
	
	<p>Richard Dawkins's <i>Selfish Gene</i> (1976): possible to think of evolution in informational terms - with genes as the organiational software</p>
	
	<p>But DNA (software) needs an organism (hardware) to run in. 
	For Dawkins; the organism is the medium through which genes influence their probability of being replicated</p>
	
	<p>Jesper Hoffmeyer: selection external/mutations internal. But mutation is random</p>
	
	<p>Claus Emmech: organism becomes passive meeting place for forces alien to itself.</p>
	
	<p>Prions: good example of the complexity of self-replication</>
	
	<p>Dawkins is not incorrect, but equating information with pattern smuggles in systemic properties</p>
	
	<p>Paul Weiss (1960s): Biology builds prosthetic devices to make up for amputations to the organic wholeness.</p>
	
	<p>Organisms are not mere assembles of parts. They grow.</p>
	
	<p>Élan vital hasn't been snuffed, it's just been pushed into smaller parts within parts - tiny simpler bits have to do the heavy lifting.</p>
