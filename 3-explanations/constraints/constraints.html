     <h1>Constraints</h1> 
    <p><strong>Constraint</strong>:</p>
    <p>The state of being restricted or confined within prescribed bounds. Constraints
      are what is not there but could have been.</p>
    <p>The concept of constraint is, in effect, a complementary concept to order, habit,
      and organization because something that is ordered or organized is restricted in
      its range and/or dimensions of variation, and consequently tends to exhibit redundant
      features or regularities.</p>
    <p>A dynamical system is constrained to the extent that it is restricted in degrees
      of freedom to change and exhibits attractor tendencies.</p>
    <p>Constraints can originate intrinsic or extrinsic to the system that is thereby
      constrained</p>
    <p>more similar = less different</p>
    <p>constraints can be extrinsic or intrinsic p192</p>
    <p>constraint is reduced variety, therefore there will be more redundancy (repetition
      of similar events) in attributes. p 192</p>
    <p>indivuation: constraints are precisely measurable in space and time.</p>
    <p>extension: constraints can have definite extension across both space and time,
      and across whole ensembles of elements and interactions.</p>
    <p>bottom-up notion of causality is limited p 201</p>
    <p>reduction of options at one level can lead to an even greater reduction of options
      in a process that depends on the first</p>
    <p>while it may often be possible to model constraint propagation and thus make general
      predictions about the emergence of higher-order dynamical constraints, it may not
      be possible to work backwards. p205</p>
    <p>Asymmetry: You can reduce, but you cannot unreduce</p>
    <p>An increase in entropy is a decrease in constraint and vice versa. In any given
      interaction, the global level of constraint can only decrease. p228</p>
    <p>this chapter goal: what is absent has causal power of organization and asymetric
      dynamics of physical or loving??? process</p>
    <p>In statistical mechanics, constraint is a technical term used to describe some
      reduction of degrees of freedom of change or a restriction on the variation of
      properties that is less than what is possible. In colloquial terms, constraint
      tends to be understood as an external limitation, reflecting some extrinsically
      imposed factor that reduces possibilities or options.</p>

    <p>two cases of dynamical conditions:</p>
    <p>microscopic cause little change to macroscopic - near-equilibrium thermodynamic
      processes</p>
    <p>microscopic can cause change to macroscopic - persistent far-from equilibrium
      thermodynamic processes</p>
    <p>Here look at 1 only. 2 in chapter 8</p>
    <p>component micro interactions: faster than interactions with systems</p>
    <p>return to stable near-equilibrium much faster</p>
    <p>highest probability will correlate with most redundant effects</p>
    <p>fluctuations cancel each other out</p>
    <p>most generalized attractor features end up have causal influence.</p>
    <p>only most redundant features manifest at higher level</p>
