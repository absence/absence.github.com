<h2>Chapter 1 ~ (W)holes</h2> 
	<p><i>Thirty spokes converge at the wheel’s hub, to a hole that allows it to turn. 
		Clay is shaped into a vessel, to enclose an emptiness that can be filled. 
		Doors and windows are cut into walls, to provide access to their protection. 
		Though we can only work with what is there, use comes from what is not there.</i> &mdash; Lao Tsui

		<p>Parable: a boy skips a stone across water. 
			How can we explain what has happened in a manner that takes into account the myriad thoughts and physical actions that just occured? p18-19</p>
		
		<p>There is a huge discrepancy between what is spontaneouusly probable in the physical [inorganic] realm 
			and the deviant [wildly improbable] introduced by organisms and minds. p20</p>
		
		<p>Even with fully detailed knowledge about the boy's current physical state might only be able to predict the next few seconds of his activity. p20</p>
		
		<p>On the other hand, a glimpse of the boy a year earlier being shown how to skip a stone, could be vastly more predictive. p20</p>
		
		<p>A shift from physical to mental causation produces far better predictive results. 'Ends determining means'. p21</p>
		
		<p>Thoughts are about possibilities. Possibilities are future events - which do not exist and may never exist. 
			And yet possibilities influence the present. p21</p>
		
		<p>This is a reversal of traditional causal knowledge: order developing from disorder. How can we account for this?</p>

		<p>We, especially scientists and philosophers, haven't even a faint notion about 'us'. 
			Even a complete physical knowledge of every atom [Laplace's demon] provides no clue as to meaning. p22</p> 
		
		
		<p>Science fails to hold notions about meaning, purpose and value. It even excludes the notion of such notions. p22</p> 
		
		<p>Information, function, purpose, meaning, intention, significance, conciousness are defined by incompleteness. 
			These exist by comparisons - comparisons to what they are not.</p>
		
		<p>The absential: Nothing matters. Actually nothing does matter. p23</p> 
		
		<p>The elephant not in the room: purpose.</p>
		
		<p>Teleology: phenomena with a purpose in mind. p23</p> 
		
		<p>Purpose has: orientation, representation, function, value, agency. p25</p> 
		
		<p>Things we make are defined for a purpose. It's function is not intrinsic, but derives fron the designer's intentions. p25</p>
		
		<p>The functions of body organs are also not intrinsic, but derive via natural selection. p25</p></p> 
		
		<p>The words intentional and teleology are overloaded with multple meanings. p26</p> 
		
		<p>English lacks a word for what is not there but is nevertheles purposeful, meaningful and valuable. p26</p>
		
		<p>Let's add '[page:Ententional ententional]' to cover the constitutive absences. p26?</p> 
		
		<p>Major challenge of this book: explain how ententional phenomena arise, how complex arises from simple. p28</p>
		
		<p>Scientific explanation requires that the thing being examined exists. Are purpose and intentions merely illusions?</p>
		
		<p>Example: a dollar buys a coffee. Dollar could be coin, paper or electronic. We term this multiple realizabillity. p28</p>
		
		<p>Plato termed such phenomena as ideal forms/general types. p28</p>	
		
		<p>The Realism/Nominalism debate = chicken or egg depate. p28</p>
		
		<p>Real causal efficacy defines functionalism; p29</p>
		
		<p>Interchaneability of consequences: different methods/causes to achieve the same result.
			Big success: Darwin's matural selection. 
			Adaptation os a general type, not anything particuar physically. p30</p>

		<p>Scientists politely ignore ententional phenomena. p30</p>  
 
		<p>We have nothing better to say than living is like being in a magic trick. With Mother nature as the magician. p31</p>
		
		<p>Scientists - Dawkins, Weiberg, Crick - cannot see the purpose of the reality they have invented/discovered/created. 
			Life is <i>nothing more than</i> the sum of the behaviors of a vast assembly of cells and molecules. p31</p> 
			
		<p>Conscious experience <i>emerges</i> from physical processes. The explanation will be a good portion of the book - p32</p>	
		
		<p>Consciousness is not magic, but do note that organic processes are not the same as inorganic. p32</p> 
		
		<p>In all this we seem always to have two parallel explanations - scientific and philosophical - that are mutually exclusice? [schizophrenic.] p33</p>
		
		<p>We are forced into a <i>Twilight Zone</i> nightmare: Are we really robots and zombies? Bags of chemicals? All our thoughts mere illusions? - p33</p> 
		
		<p>That would be an absurd thought. That we are an illusion is unimaginable. Fodor: it would be the end of the world. - p33</p> 
		
		<p>But is magic more palatable? As the faithful imply? - p33?</p> 
		
		<p>Science is tending towards being able to explain, but the scientists are in denial... p34</p>

		<p>A study of what causes things is ancient. p34</p>
		
		<p>In the realm of Aristotle's four causes: ententional processes are expressions of final causality. p35</p> 

		<p>Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza: tell us that descibing purpose and value is like discussing black boxes within black boxes. a vicious regression. p34</p>
		
		<p>Science has been highly successful in gradually replacing these black boxes with mechanistic processes. p35</p>
		
		<p>Greatest success in this process: natural selection. p35</p>
		
		<p>Darwin trumps Paley's 'a watch must have a watchmaker'. p35</p>
		
		<p>Gives us metaphor of an immemse machine full of smaller machines. p36</p>
		
		<p>Dawkins characterizes evolution as the blind watchmaker. p36</p>
		
		<p>Note that there are significant differences between machines and organisms [life]. p36</p>
		
		<p>These differences [will be an ongoing topic of discussion] and may be charaterized as follows - p36-37</p>
		
		<p>Machines:
		<ul> 
			<li>are assembled to do something for some end by some external process</li>
			<li>are engineered artifacts</li>
			<li>obey an order that derives from outside</li>
			<li>are built or made<br /></li> 
			<li>arise from bringing together and systematically assembling selected parts</li>
			<li>have physical behaviors are anticipated</li>
			
			<li>are simplifications of the causal world</li>
			<li>are finite</li>
			<li>have features and future states are fully describable</li>
			<li>are closed from variation except as imposed extrinsically</li>
			<li>are predicted on a conception of causality that excludes and yet assumes teleology</li>
			<li>beg for a watchmaker</li>
		</ul> 
		</p> 
		
		<p>Organisms:
		<ul> 
			<li>are as precise and as integrated as any machine, but little else compares</li>
			<li>grow by multiplication of cells<br /></li> 
			<li>a process of division and differentiation</li> 
			<li>arise from less differentiated pre-cursors<br /></li> 
			<li>wholes precede parts<br /></li> 
			<li>integration is intrinsic<br /></li> 
			<li>design occurs spontaneously<br /></li> 
			<li>machine metaphor is over simplification, misleading - p36</li>
		</ul> 
		</p> 
		
		<p>If we think of ourselves as machines then we also need a watchmaker [deity]. p37</p>

		<p>Does what we have now exist since the beginning of time? p37</p> 
		
		<p>Phenomena appear seemingly without cause regarding things that don't exist. p38</p> 
		
		<p>Descartes: this problem sunders any connection between the physical and the mental. p38</p>
		
		<p>For science information, representation and function are shorthand proxies for understood but long, clumsy, mechanistic accounts. p39</p>
		
		<p>But these accounts become regressive - fail to eleminate absential qualities. p39</p>
		
		<p>Philosophers: assume the ententional is some primitixe attribute - like mass or charge. 
			But then what are the differences between machines and organisms? Inorganic and organic? 
			What would cause the crossing of the threshold with the development of life. p40</p>
			
		<p>Science: all processes involve a change in information. 
			But this does not fully resolve because of scientists use a special definition of informaation 
			that measures only differences and order without reference to any function [maining/purpose/value]. p40</p>

		<p>Even accepting proposition that all physical process are also information processes 
			does not eliminate need to explain differences between imorganic and organic. 
			Or how senteience and end-directed arose from the earth. p40</p>
			
		<p>Why do only DNA molecules convey information and not the other polymers? p40</p>

		<p>Don't need to know how our brains are like clouds, but why and how they differ from clouds. p40</p>
		
		<p>Cause came out of nowhere. p41</p>
		
		<p>Usual response: well they are organized differently. Then please explain the organizational diffrences. p41</p>
		
		<p>You cannot avoid teleology on the one hand and invoke it in the other. p41</p>
		
		<p>Implying that teleology is merely heuristics for things that are too difficult to explain easiy is disingenuous. p41</p>

		<p>Have our own cognitive biases deceived us - using our own science to do so? p42</p> 
		
		<p>Let us follow the Toaist metaphor: let us pay attention to the holes. We need to recognize absentialism. p42</p> 
		
		<p>The physical influence of thought, function and value depend on unreal causes. p43</p> 
		
		<p>This is an inversion of how we normally think. Old thinking: it takes more than the sum of of the parts to make a whole. p43</p>
		
		<p>The (w)hole is less than the sum of the parts. And certainly less than all the things the whole could have been. p43</p> 
		
		<p>When something displays ententional properties, it depends on the fact that something is missing. p43</p> 
		
		<p>We must stop thinking about the <i>content</i> of a thought, the <i>vehicle</i> of a sign. p43</p>
		
		<p>This requires an inversion of perspective, a figure/background reversal. p43</p>
		
		<p>We must move from from billiard ball causality to quantum processing associated with proability. p44</p>
		
		<p>we have failed to overcome our notions of things being stuff rather than beng process - and forced us into a dualistic notion. p44 </p>
		
		<p>We must start paying attention to what's not there. p44 </p>
		
		<p>Scientific challenge: We must naturalize teleology. p44</p>
