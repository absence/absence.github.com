    <p>Homeodynamics:</p>
    <p>Any dynamic process that spontaneously reduces a system's constraints to their
      minimum and thus more evenly distributes system properties across space and time.</p>
    <p>The second law of thermodynamics describes the paradigm case.</p>

        <li>orthograde and contragrade dynamics reverse in dominance as we consider adjacent
          levels of process.

        <li>homeodynamic tendencies can produce orthrgrade tendencies at a higher level

    <p>A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from
      a constrained ('ordered') state to a less constrained ('disordered') state, which
      tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed
      direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade
      process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained
      external work (arrows in the image on the right).</p>

    <p>The title of this chapter - Homeodynamics - coins a term that I think can more generally
      describe this most basic orthograde dynamic wherever we encounter it. It is a dynamic
      that spontaneously reduces constraints to their minimum and thus more evenly distributes
      whatever property is being changed from moment to moment and locus to locus. Distinguishing
      the general case from the specific case of thermodynamic entropy increase becomes
      indispensable as we begin to analyze the dynamic interdependencies that span more
      than two levels of scale. For example, it allows us to distinguish a powerful general
      principle: orthograde and contragrade dynamics reverse in dominance as we consider
      adjacent levels of process.</p>

    <p>And, as we've seen, this contragrade interatomic dynamic enables the higher-level
      thermodynamic tendency to be actualized - an orthograde tendency dependent on lower-level
      contragrade interactions. For our purposes, what is important is that this alternation
      of orthograde and contragrade processes at adjacent hierarchic levels of compositional
      scale has no necessary upper bound, and with each hierarchic iteration the potential
      complexity of these interactions increases. As we will see in the next two chapters,
      the special contragrade relationships that can be generated by the juxtaposition
      of different orthograde processes can produce complex forms of constraint. By these
      means, simple homeodynamic tendencies can be organized into highly indirect and
      convoluted relationships with respect to one another, ultimately producing unprecedented
      higher-level orthograde tendencies. This is the engine of emergence.</p>
