	<h2>Chapter 5 ~ Emergence</h2>
	<p><i>. . . we need an account of the material world in which it isn’t absurd to claim that it produced us. 
		—translated and rephrased by the Terence Deacon from Ilya Prigogine and Isabella Stengers, 1979</i></p>
    
	<p>Glossary definition</p>
	<p><b>Emergence</b>: A term used to designate an apparently discontinuous transition from one mode of causal properties to another of a higher rank, 
		typically associated with an increase in scale in which lower-order component interactions contribute global properties 
		that appear irreducible to the lower-order interactions. 
		The term has a long and diverse history, but throughout this history it has been used to describe the way 
		that living and mental processes depend upon chemical and physical processes,
		yet exhibit collective properties not exhibited by non-living and non-mental processes, 
		and in many cases appear to violate the ubiquitous tendencies exhibited by these component interactions.</p>

		<p><i>This section: characterizes emergence as a recent, unpredictable, hierarchy of phenomena.</i></p>
		
		<p>For most of the 13 billion years of the universe, the universe has not had ententional properties.</p>

		<p>Ententional properties appear to have came out of nowhere, nevertheless must have obeyed the laws of physics.</p>
		
		<p>Emergence: spontaneous novelty / almost like magic.</p>
		
		<p>Harold Morowitz: identified a hierarchy of over twenty 'emergences' of higher order out of smaller/simpler components.</p>
		
		<p>All representations are simplifications. Many transitions are beyond our capability to represent - therefore remain unpredictable.</p>
		
		<p>Proving ultimate unpredictability is not as important as removing the mysteries/lesser unpredictabilities (gaps in our knowldedge) 
			that cause new types of order to emerge</p>
		
		<p>Question: which are the correct things to question?</p>

		<p><i>This section: covers the history of emergence of emergence in the 19th century. 
			Historically one might say that emergence may be seen as the end of the beginning.<br>
			Topics covered: history, biology, philosophy</i></p>	
		
		<p>Emergence appears in the 19th century. 
			Darwin's natural selection spurs Herbert Spencer to consider simililar principles for psychology and sociology.</p>	
		
		<p>Nature became viewed through lens of materialism. Teleology and metaphysics were trashed by science.</p>	
		
		<p>But how to explain the teleologic nature of life and mental process?</p>	
<!-- I wish Deacon spent a nit more tine or had a clearer explanation here.. -->		
		<p>If entetional properties are not already part of the inorganic world, how could such featurers be derived from or grow out of the inorganic?</p>	
		
		<p>Ententional could not be part of foundation [intrinsic] nor could they be denied.</p>	
		
		<p>George Henrey Lewes in <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i> (1874-9) first defines emergence. 
			Lewes appears to have been influenced by John Stuart Mill/<i>A System of Logic</i> and the discontinuities of chemical reactions. 
			The end result being greater/different than the sum of the parts.</p>
			
		<p>Earlier John Locke/late 1600s had accounted for complex ideas arising out of 'atoms' of experience.
			Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck theorize in a similar manner reggarding nature.</p>
			
		<p>George Batsen explains how Lamarck turm=ns philosophy inside out: 
			he 'Mind at the top' alters from being the explainer of all things to being the thing that needs explaining.</p>

		<p>Teleology be becomes the result of life not its cause.</p>
		
		<p>Key event: 1959 Charles Darwin's <i>On the Origin of the Species</i>.</p>
		
		<p>Goal-seeking organisms not required. Teleology may be dispensed with. Natural selection = statistics.</p>
		
		<p>Functional design can be seen as a law-like process - no magic tricks needed.</p>
		
		<p>Alfred Russel Wallace (co-discoverer of natural selection) and others believed that 
			the process of natural selection could be applied to human experience as well.</p>
			
		<p>If something as complex as the human body can arrive at the roll of the dice,
			then why is teleology needed for human cognition?</p>

		<p><i>This section: introduces and characterizes reductionism (AKA 'smallism') and gives note of its issues.<br>
		Topics covered: History, Biochemistry, Philosophy</i></p>
		
		<p>Emergemtism a respose to another 19th century theory: Reductionism.</p>
		
		<p>Reductionism: complicatated phenomena may be be better understood by separating them into component parts.</p>
		
		<p>The whole may be understood as the interaction ofthe parts. An extension to Atomism - keep divinf things until you get to the smallest bit.</p>
		
		<p>But: you never reach the indivisible. There's no stopping it.</p>
		
		<p>Thomas Hobbs: even human interaction may be reduced to the study of bodies in motion.</p>
		
		<p>Robert Wilson: termed the approach 'smallism' the smaller the more fundamental.</p>

		<p>Many profound successes: DNA, chemistry, physics, neuroscience...p>		
         
		<p>Not always clear that things become simpler as they become smaller.</p>
		
		<p>Smallism focuses attention away from interaction complexity.</p>
		
		<p>Provides false impression: analyzing the overall organization may be less important than studying the components.</p>
		
		<p>Rcently, according to people like Stephen Hawking: Complexity and interaction dynamics have started coming into focus.</p>

		<p>British emegentists (Alexander, Broad, Morgan <i>et al</i>): theorize a middle path between reductionism and vitalism.</p>
		
		<p>Influenced by J S Mill: summing up the parts is not good enough. Just look at chemistry where combining two gasses can create a solid.</p>
		
		<p>Must distinguish higher level from lower level properties by non-additive forms of interaction.</p>
		
		<p>Mill defines homopathic (additive, highly predictable) and heteropathic (bridging, idiosyncrantic) laws. 
			Higher level properties not discontinuous from lower level, just not predictable using lower level laws.</p>
