	<h2>Part 1 Summary ~ Chapters 1-5 ~ Outlining the Problem</h2> 
	
		<p>Deacon summarizes Part 1 as follows:</p>
		
		<blockquote>I show that the conceptual riddles posed by absential phenomena have not been dealt with, despite claims that they have been overcome, 
			but rather that they have been swept under the rug in various ingenious ways. 
			By critiquing the history of efforts to explain them or explain them away, 
			I argue that our various efforts have only served to insinuate these difficulties more cryptically 
			into our current scientific and humanistic paradigms.

			<li><h4>Absence</h4>
				<p>Introduces the term 'absential'. Can what is not there matter? Can the ansential have physical, scientifically verifiable consequence?</p>
				
				<p>Are we more than collections of atoms?
					
					Why is the absential missing in science?
					Are we stuck with Descartes? Can we only explain eveything is there is an observer?
					Does the history of the number zero offer parallels with the absential?
					Can we envisage the physical and the meangful coming together?
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h4>(W)holes</h4>
				<p>Introduces the adjective 'ententional'. How can something come from nothing?</p>
			
				<p>How can something come from nothing?
					How can order develop from disorder?
					If life the sum of the behaviors of vast numbers of atoms?
					Can future possibilities affect the present more than the past?
					Has science failed to explain meaning purpose and value?
					How do ententional phenomena arise? How does the complex arise from the simple?
					Are we illusions? Is it all a magic trick?
					If we are machines, then do we need a watchmaker?
					Why does only DNA carry information and not the other polymers?
					How can cause come out of nowhere?
					How much do our cognitive biases deceive us?
					Is the whole less than the sum of the parts?
					How can we make sense of the efficacy of absence?
				</p>
			
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Homunculi</h4>
				<p>Characterizes the term '<i>homunculis</i>'. What is the mind in the mind/body problem?</p>
			
				<p> If there is a little man inside the brain, then what is inside his brain?
					Does the humuculus have a life of its own?
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Golems</h4>
				<p>Characterizes the term '<i>golem</i>'. What is the body in the mind/body problem?</p>
				
				<p>Does science sacrifice completeness for consistency? 
					How much can you reduce, simplify or fractionate before you lose the essence?</p>
					If thoughts can be embodied in computers then does teleology disappear?
					If the mind is a computer, then how did it learn?
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Teleonomy</h4>
				<p>Characterizes the terms 'teleology', 'teleonomy' and 'teleomatic'. Which came first - the mind or the body? </p>
				
				<p>Do living things disobey the laws of nature?
					What are the differences between human design, natural selection and happy accident?
					Are body parts teleological, teleonomic or teleomatic? 
					How does purpose arise from stuff? 
					How can things start with no purpose and yet end up with purpose>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h4>Emergence</h4>
				<p>Characterizes the term 'emergence'. How and when did the mind/body problem discover itself?</p>
				
				<p>When did emergence emerge? 
				How does stuff learn without a teacher? 
				Are there correlations between size and emergence?
				Can reducing things to the simplest and smallest levels povide varifiable answers?
				Why can you reassemble a machine but not an animal?
