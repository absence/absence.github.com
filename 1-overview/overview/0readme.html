	<h3>Preface</h3>
	
		<p>Deacon tells you: <i>Ex nililo fit</i> - Nothing from nothing. A difference that makes no difference makes no difference.</p>
		
		<p>Does reading a book make a difference?</p>
		
		<p>If you feel that a book means something, has import or could be useful then what should you do?</p>
		
		<p>If you just put a book that you have finished reading on the shelf and go on to the next book, then were you merely passing some of the time until you die?</p>
	
		<p>This effort on a repository - the result of reading a book - is certainly also a way of passing time until death occurs.</p>
		
		<p>Is there a significant difference between to two actions?</p>
		
		<p>Only time will tell if the ongoing performances or unfurlings of Deacon's thoughts - as they pass into the minds of reader after reader - will a cause a significant difference.</p>

		<p>And if the book causes a difference what would it be?</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>The repository allows you to re-read the book without re-reading the whole book. Like cue cards. Sign posts?</p>
		
		<p>It's an aide memoire, an exigesis. </p>
		
		<p>Secondly this repo tries to identify and highlight analytical tools that have been identified or are proposed.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>This repo does not attempt to invent. The idea is to look for readily available giants that have backs to stand on.</p>
		
		<p>Ontologies that are being used include:</p>
		
		<p>Books: the traditional format of a book: table of contents, contents, index of contents.</p>
		
		<p>Presentations: "Tell'em whatya goin to tell'em, Tell'em, then tell'em whatya told'em."</p>
		
		<p>Newspapers: The five W's: Who, what when, where and why.</p>
		
		<p>Programming: Differentiating between properties and methods, content and methods</p>
		
		<p>Gaming: Gathering of assets while progressing through levels.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>This repository does several things.</p>
		
		<p>the first is a 'table of contents' written in an old fashioned way. [I have had a brief look through Google Books but have not yet found a good example of what I think I am looking for.]</p>
		
		<p>In this sort of 'table' of contents' Every section is listed and each comes with a short description of the section.</p>
		
		<p>Also books might have a summary at the beginning of each chapter.</p>
		
		<p>The second thing this repo provides is an expanded index.</p>
		
		<p>The third is an expanded glossary.</p>
		
	<h3>Assumptions</h3>
		<p>The first assumption is that you have read <i>Incomplete Nature</i> and are in the process
			of re-reading the book, trying to piece together the many topics that are covered
			while trying to retain what you have already read.
		</p>

		<p>A second assumption is that you are juggling the book or ereader and have
			this document open on your computer.
		</p>

		<p>Very quick access to secondary sources for every key topic mentioned in a section
		- almost entirely links to the relevant Wikipedia page </p>
