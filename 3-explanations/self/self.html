<p>Self is
<p>contragrade
<p>strongly emergent

<p>intentional
<p>homeodynamic, morphodynamic and teleodynamic
<p>strong emergentism??
<p>
<p>intrinsic, not extrinsic.
<p>
<p>Homeodynamic / When
<p>
<p>Over time self:
<p>* evolves
<p>* develops
<p>* differentiates
<p>* changes
<p>
<p>Selves p464
<p>
<p>	* mature slowly
<p>	* differentiate incrementally
<p>	* are both the cause and the consequence of this process.
<p>
<p>
<p>The emergence of the form of self that characterizes human subjectivity is in contrast a very recent, very special, and very much higher-order variant of this first transition. p467
<p>
<p>moment-by-moment
<p>subjective sense of self
<p>- continuous
<p>- seconds
<p>takes time to wake up - for self to organize itself
<p>
<p>Velocity/Rate of time:
<p>billions of years to evolve
<p>astronomical number of processes 
<p>taking place in millesecond time frame

<p>Morphodynamic / Where

<p>Individuated selves
<p>complex multi-leveled selves
<p>
<p>>> Locus of Agency here?
<p>
<p>Boundaries
<p>
<p>protective encasement is a nearly ubiquitous feature of organism design—whether for viruses, bacteria, amoebas, plants, or animals—because reciprocity is always potentially disruptable by the intrusion of extrinsic influences. p471
<p>
<p>boundaries - may be ambiguous
<p>process of differentiation
<p>end-directed
<p>specialized bounding surfaces
<p>selectively permeable
<p>internal/external mediator
<p>
<p>although our attention tends to be drawn to these boundary interfaces when focusing on what constitutes self, this interface is better understood as an adaptation to better preserve the self already there. p 471

<p>
<p>The metabolic self (so to speak) of these cells is bounded in the cell membrane, but that feature of biological self which maintains this ultimate hedge against the ravages of entropy—duplication—has been shifted to the whole organism.
<p>
<p>Whole/Part

<p>Self is, in all cases, the origin, target, and beneficiary of functional organization, whether molecular or mental. p466

<p>brain selves?
<p>
<p>Does every self have its characteristic sentience?
<p>
<p>Central thesis  the core property which links the selves of even the simplest life forms with that seemingly ineffable property that characterizes the human experience of self is a special form of dynamical organization: teleodynamics. 
<p>
<p>What has not been made explicit, however, is that all teleodynamic processes are implicitly individuated, that is, they are closed in a fundamental sense with respect to other dynamical features of the world. 
<p>
<p>This special form of closure is reflected in the phrase “reflective individuation” used earlier, which I introduce to explicitly avoid using the prefix “self-” (as in self-maintaining, self-organizing, self-reproducing) in defining the fundamental organizational logic of self.
