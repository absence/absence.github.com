	<h2>Book Summary</h2>
	
		<p>A concise summary of the book might be:</p>
		
		<p><b><i>Incomplete Nature</i> sets out to resolve Descartes's mind-body problem using the scientific method.</b></p>
		
		<p>This statement may be divided into three parts: the philosophy, the science and the results.
	
	<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-body_problem' target='_blank'>mind-body problem</a> as follows:</p> 
			
			<blockquote>
			The mindâ€“body problem in philosophy examines the relationship between mind and matter, 
			and in particular the relationship between consciousness and the brain. 
			The question, as Colin McGinn puts it, is how "technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter.
			</blockquote>
		
		<p>The consideration of this problem is ever so old. With <i>cogito ergo sum</i>, 
			Descartes just happened to coin a particularly succinct and memorable phrase for the problem. 
			Any meaningful resolution of the philosophical aspects should take into account the thinking of major philosophical thinkers and tendencies.</p>
		
	<h4>Science</h4>
	
		<p>Wikipedia introduces its article on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method' target='_blank'>scientific method</a> as follows:</p>
			
			<blockquote>
			The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
			To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
			The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, 
			consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."
			</blockquote>
		
		<p>Any resolution of the scientific aspects of the problem should take into account a gamut of issues 
		- ranging from that thought you just had all the way down to whatever Higg's boson may be in or not in your brain as the case may be. 
		In between, many topics - such as: How do instincts and language arise? How did the inorganic become organic?
		What was there before there was the second law of thermodynamics? How much more is there? -  must be all be totted, tallied and tested.</p>
	
	<h4>Results</h4>
	
		<p>In other words, the purposeful resolution of the mind-body problem should gauge everything we know and value.</p>
	
		<p><i>Incomplete Nature</i> is the attempt to appraise the values of what we do know from many sciences and blend these into new methods (standards?) of reckoning.</p>
		
		<p>But wait, wait. There's more!</p>
		
		<p>There's a lot we don't know. There's probably more out there that we cannot measure than that which we can.</p>
		
		<p>So, as Deacon might say, the book is about (w)holes - because there are so many holes in (y)our knowledge.</p> 
		
		<p><i>[or is this Deacon just being holier than thou? ;-]</i></p>
		
	<h4>Deacon's Words</h4>	
		
		<blockquote>
			The core hypothesis of this book is that all teleodynamic phenomena necessarily depend upon, and emerge from, simpler morphodynamic and homeodynamic processes. 
			This implies that the complex intentional features that characterize our thoughts and subjective experiences 
			must likewise emerge from a background of neurological morphodynamic and homeodynamic processes. 
			p487
