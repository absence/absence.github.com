    <h2>Chapter 1 ~ (W)holes</h2> 
		<p><i>Thirty spokes converge at the wheel’s hub, to a hole that allows it to turn. 
			Clay is shaped into a vessel, to enclose an emptiness that can be filled. 
			Doors and windows are cut into walls, to provide access to their protection. 
			Though we can only work with what is there, use comes from what is not there.</i> &mdash; Lao Tsui

    <h3>1 A stone's throw - p 18</h3>

			organization
		</p> 
		
		<p><i>This section provides descriptions of various aspects of the sepration of thought processes from phyical processes. 
			It comsiders a vision (that really exists from a scientific point of view) of a future based on the past that informs the present.</i></p>
		
		<p>Parable: a boy skips a stone across water. 
		How can we explain what happened in a manner that takes the myriad thoughts and physical actions into account? p18-19</p>
		
		<p>There is a huge discrepancy between what is spontaneouusly probable in the physical [inorganic] realm 
		and the deviant [wildly improbable] improbable introdoced by organisms and minds. p20</p>
		
		<p>Having fully detailed knowledge about the boy's physical state might only be able to predict the new few seconds of his activity.</p>
		
		<p>A glimpse of the boy being shown how to skip a stone, could be vastly more predictive.</p>
		
		<p>A shift from physical to mental causation produces far better results. p21</p>
		
		<p>Thoughts are about possibilities. Possibilities are future events - which do not exist and may never exist. 
			And yet possibilities influence the present. p21</p>
		
		<p>This is a reversal of causal knowledge: order developing from disorder. How can we account for this?</p>

		<p><i>This section: The failure of science to explain meaning, purpose and value.<br>
			Absence is characterized as being of the essence because meaning, purpose and value are so much about what is not present but could be imagined.<br>
			The word [page:Ententional ententional] is introduced to describe the things we know that do not exist.<br>
			A number of other terms are introduced that will be called upon that will be used throughout the remainder of the book.</i></p>
		
		<p>We, especially scientists and philosophers, haven't even a faint notion about 'us'. 
			Even complete physical knowledge of every atom [Laplacian demon] provides no clue as to meaning. p22</p> 
		
		<p>Science fails to hold notions about meaning, purpose and value. It even excludes the notion of such notions. p22</p> 
		
		<p>Information, function, purpose, meaning, intention, significance, conciousness are defined by incompleteness. 
			These exist by comparisons - comparisons to what they are not.</p>
		
		<p>The absential: Nothing matters. Actually nothing does matter. p23</p> 
		
		<p>The elephant not in the room: purpose.</p>
		
		<p>Teleology: phenomena with a purpose in mind. p23</p> 
		
		<p>Purpose has: orientation, representation, function, value, agency. p25</p> 
		
		<p>Things we make are defined for a purpose. It's function is not intrinsic, but derives fron the designer's intentions. p25</p>
		
		<p>The functions of body organs are also not intrinsic, but derive via natural selection. p25</p></p> 
		
		<p>The words intentional and teleology are overloaded with multple meanings. p26</p> 
		
		<p>English lacks a word for what is not there but is nevertheles purposeful, meaningful and valuable. p26</p>
		
		<p>Let's add '[page:Ententional ententional]' to cover the constitutive absences. p26?</p> 
		
		<p>Major challenge of this book: explain how ententional phenomena arise, how complex arises from simple. p28</p>
		
		<p>Scientific explanation requires that the thing being examined exists. Are purpose and intentions merely illusions?</p>
		
		<p>Example: a dollar buys a coffee. Dollar could be coin, paper or electronic. We term this multiple realizabillity. p28</p>
		
		<p>Plato termed such phenomena as ideal forms/general types. p28</p>	
		
		<p>The Realism/Nominalism debate = chicken or egg depate. p28</p>
		
		<p>Real causal efficacy defines Functionalism; p29</p>
		
		<p>Interchaneability of consequences: different methods/causes to achieve the same result.
			Big success: Darwin's matural selection. 
			Adaptation os a general type, not anything particuar physically. p30</p>

		<p><i>This section: highlights the current schism between science explaining the physical and philosophy exploring the conscious.<br>
			Possible answers to life include: we are bags of chemicals, or we are zombies or it's all an illusion or it's all magic anyhow.<br>
			For the moment, science appears to prefer blindness.
			</i></p>
		
		<p>Ententional phenomena</p>  
		<ul> 
			<li>scientists politely ignore - p30</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>We have nothing better to say than living is like being in a magic trick. With Mother nature as the magician. p31</p>
		
		<p>Scientists - Dawkins, Weiberg, Crick - cannot see the purpose of the reality they have invented/discovered/created. 
			Life is <i>nothing more than</i> the sum of the behaviors of a vast assembly of cells and molecules. p31</p> 
			
		<p>Conscious experience <i>emerges</i> from physical processes. The explanation will be a good portion of the book - p32</p>	
		
		<p>Consciousness is not magic, but note that organic processes are not the same as inorganic.</p> 
		
		<p>In all this we seem always to have two parallel explanations - scientific and philosophical - that are mutually exclusice? [schizophrenic.]</p>
		
		<p>We are forced into a Twilight Zone nightmare: Are we really robots and zombies? Bags of chemicals? All our thoughts mere illusions? - p32</p> 
		
		<p>That would be an absurd thought. That we are an illusion is unimaginable. Fodor: it would be the end of the world. - p33</p> 
		
		<p>But is magic more palatable? As the faithful imply? - p33?</p> 
		
		<p>Science is tending towards being able to explain, but the scientists are in denial...</p> 
		
		<p>[It's a 'whodunnit'.]</p>
